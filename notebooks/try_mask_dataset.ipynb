I kept the rules simple: drink nothing I consider to be a soda. Not the most precise way of going about it, but this included a carbonated, sugary drinks laden with HFCS and caffeine.\\n\\nI was a total addict. I would drink about 3 or more cans a day of soda, usually Coke or Dr Pepper. I would feel shitty and upset until I got a soda at lunch, which would make me feel wonderful. I loved the way it tasted, I loved the way my lunch tasted with it. \\n\\nEven though I am skinny, I was afraid that if my metabolism started slowing down, so much soda meant I would quickly pack on weight. Also, with the ridiculous amounts of sugar, diabetes was always a scary but real danger. So I decided begin a healthy revolution for myself by not drinking sodas.\\n\\nDay one went without incident. I grabbed a metal bottle and filled it with water, and this bottle has followed me throughout. I drank water for lunch and meals, but I wasn't particularly thirsty the whole day. I missed the taste of soda. I started getting a headache by the end of the day.\\n\\nDay two was terrible. I was tired, and felt disconnected from reality.  I had a constant headache, and it got worse throughout the day. Anti-headache medicines could not fight my body's wrath at the sudden starvation of sugar and caffeine. In a desperate effort to stave off headaches, I got some coffee to see if my body would take the peace offering of caffeine through a medium that isn't soda. This made things worse, as soon I found myself shaking (as coffee usually makes me do) and I still had a headache. I shook myself to sleep.\\n\\nDay three might have been the worst. My headaches from day two carried over, but were dulled a bit. Some excedrin kept them away for a bit. But while in my blessed excedrin-high, I decided to get some sexual release, and I was slammed with the worst headache of my life. I could feel this headache bearing down on the top of my head, like nothing I had ever felt before. I tried to sleep, but laying down didn't seem to stop this monster of a headache. I eventually got to sleep, and when I woke up, the typical dull headaches were back. My body was not happy with me.\\n\\nDay four was better. I had even lesser headaches, and some advil seemed to end them one hundred percent. I started actually being thirsty for water, and not just drinking it at meals because I am American and I have to drink *something* at meals. I drank water and enjoyed it. As the night went on, my headaches seemed to go away.\\n\\nAnd here I am, living through day five. I haven't had a headache today, and I've had my trusty metal water bottle by my side to keep me hydrated. I didn't talk to any doctors or nutritionists before doing this, and some redditors may find some things that I did very wrong, but I feel like I achieved my goal.

Very few employees had been trained properly, equipment was all out of calibration, documents had errors in them, etc. \\n\\nI haven't been given any negative feedback on my job so far. In fact, on Friday they assigned 2 additional employees to work for me (so now I'm managing 9 people.) Furthermore we haven't had any major disasters that could be considered my fault. \\n\\nToday I discover a job posting advertising my exact title at my current company. It's a small company entering our slowest time of the year, business-wise and there's no room for two managers with my title.

Therefore, any cruelty or kindness was done by itself, to and as itself, under the self-imposed illusion of not knowing it\\'s true nature.\\n\\nThat sustained me for a long time, as most arguments from atheists against god focus on the Christian/Judaic/Muslim versions of god, and the kind of god I believed in was protected from 99% of those arguments because there was nothing dogmatic or anti-scientific about it to argue against.\\n\\nAlong with this, however, I bought into a lot of new age woo woo stuff like various kinds of divination, psuedoscience, reincarnation, astrology, dowsing, crop circles, homeopathy, and a vast laundry list of unfounded claptrap.\\n\\nOnce I started taking an interest in science, and found most of those \"accessory\" beliefs debunked, I had to take it one step further and apply the same rigorous protocol to my belief in \"Spirit\", as I called my version of god.\\n\\nI came to the conclusion that, in the end, since this being I believed in was not judgmental and there was no heaven or hell to go to, then it didn\\'t really matter if I believed or not. After all, if I was wrong, this being wouldn\\'t have minded anyway. I didn\\'t have to deal with the fear of pissing it off or being punished. \\n\\nSo, I had to take the most honest stance I could: there is no evidence for this being, therefore, nothing to support a belief in it. I now lack a belief in this being, which makes me an atheist. If I do end up surviving my death, perhaps I will recognize it as this being experiencing through me what it\\'s like to lack such a belief, then fine. But, since there is no evidence, the only honest stance is \"I don\\'t know, but I certainly don\\'t see any evidence to support it.\"\\n\\nDid anyone else go through a similar journey to atheism, rather than the usual \"I broke away from religion\" or \"I was always of this mindset\"?\\n\\ntl;dr - Came to atheism through a different route than many people, curious who else was in a similar boat.',\n",

       " 'I\\'m currently taking the first level of college chemistry, and while attempting to finish a lab report, I became ridiculously confused.\\n\\nThe post laboratory questions include the statement that both H3PO4 and H3BO4 are polyprotic acids, and refer you to the textbook for information on how to write out the disassociation steps for each of them. The phosphoric acid (H3PO4) brought up no issues for me. However, I had read online that boric acid (H3PO4) did not dissociate in water. I looked up \"boric acid\" in the index of my textbook, and turned to a section on boron compounds. H3BO3 was mentioned, and refered to it as boric acid. The text explicitly stated that boric acid was not a polyprotic acid, but a monoprotic acid - instead of losing a hydrogen ion to create H30, H3BO3 accepted an OH ion from the water to create B(OH)4.\\n\\nI wasn\\'t too worried at that point; though both H3BO3 and H3BO4 were referred to as boric acid, the formulas were different, so it seemed entirely possible that H3BO4 could dissociate in water though H3BO3 could not. But when I looked online, I couldn\\'t find very much information on the difference between the two. I found H3BO3 being called orthoboric acid, but occasionally the formula for orthoboric acid was given as H3BO4. Though I couldn\\'t find much mention of H3BO4, it was most often called perboric acid, which I couldn\\'t find any useful information on. \\n\\nThe easy thing to do would be to use the same dissociation steps for H3BO4 as I had for H3PO4 with every P replaced with a B, but since I know one form of boric acid is unique in that its formula resembles that of a polyprotic acid but actually is a monoprotic acid, I\\'m not sure if something strange would also be going on with H3PO4.\\n\\n...

After listening to him talk about Mythbusters and watch his compilation video of the best explosions from the show (set to the ending of the 1812 Overture, of course), I realized that the popular show Mythbusters may help popularize science and help make people curious, it still relies too heavily on large explosions and flashy \"experiments\" that SHOULD NOT BE TRIED AT HOME.\\n\\nNow I bring the question to the old show, Junkyard Wars / Scrapheap Challenge.  What happened to it?  What happened to shows that were about making things, engineering and human ingenuity?

The show got canceled in the US after the 7th season (Junkyard Megawars 2) because the production costs were too high.  I was 16 at the time.\\n\\nThere was something special about that show.  Something that I believe popular shows like Mythbusters completely neglect.  The ability to make things, instead of destructively testing them.  The kind of frantic creativity that was characteristic of this country from the Cold War.  Not saying we need a political/military stalemate to get our science on, but seriously, just look at the situation in colleges today.  America isn\\'t producing nearly enough engineers.\\n\\nJunkyard Wars helped inspire a few of the engineers I find myself working with today.  However, the majority of the engineers I find in my classes have not even heard of the show.  They are boring, uninspired and do not realize that engineering can be a fun, productive endeavor.  They do not appreciate the beauty of making things with your own hands.  They like their books and their equations.\\n\\nSure, I like my academic life too, but inside my heart I still harbor this one little dream.

Immediately after the first semester concluded, I was offered an internship via one of my professors. It's a NPO that has been around for almost two decades and their website, obviously, has a lot of content built up already; most of the recent content is dynamically driven, but the older articles are static and using templates.\\n\\nThe job is to convert all the content to WordPress and create an entirely custom theme to display various types of articles and news from each of their chapters. Of course, afterwards, I’m to provide training and technical support for a period of time. It was estimated (by my professor) the whole ordeal would take about eight months and they offered me next to nothing. I would make over twice as much continuing to work at my minimum-wage job.\\n\\nI countered for twice as much, assuming they wouldn’t be able to afford it and was okay with that. I didn’t feel like it would be a pleasant experience considering their offer. But they came back and said they could afford about that much, so I accepted and took time off my previous job to do it. I’m sorely regretting it now.\\n\\nConsidering I have no experience with the business aspect and freelance is hard and terrifying for even seasoned web developers, I expected I’d be getting some direction and heavy guidance from my professor. Not so. He offers very little until I do something the wrong way. If I contact him with questions, I usually get patronizing and semi-rude responses. It’s also worth noting he was the previous (and volunteer) developer for the organization and seems to be pretty close to the client.\\n\\nI’m feeling extremely discouraged and turned off to the whole project. My friends/family know how I’m feeling about the whole thing but I’m getting very little support. They seem to think I should just suck it up and do it for the experience, no matter how dismal it seems to be.\\n\\nAre they right? Will I screw myself out of further opportunities if this one doesn’t work out? If not, is it even worth it for me to try to “save” the project? At this point, I haven’t turned in a project plan yet and I doubt there will be any contract signing.\",\n",

The event has grown and changed over the years and continues to do so.\\n\\nIf you've heard about it, you may have heard that it is a crazy hippy nude fest in the desert where there are no rules and everyone is eating granola and singing kumbaya around a campfire. While I won't pretend that doesn't happen (certainly not in my camp!) I will state that Burning Man is *far more* then that. It's way more geek then it is hippy, in fact it is one of the most techy places on earth. Hell, from what I understand Google used to RECRUIT there...I can believe it.  It's also a place of civic pride!  I've volunteered to help make the city tick for the past few years being both a Greeter, a lamp lighter, and this year I'm going to try Rangering. (*Update: Rangering was fucking AWESOME, I think I found a new calling*)\\n\\nBurning Man is highly organized. It has streets, addresses, sporadic power grids, radio stations, a zip code. Hell, it has an airport and you can send AND receive mail there!  It is the 3rd largest city in Nevada during the week it happens and trust me, it is a city. Here is a photo of the event taken from an airplane - as you can see it is very well organized and laid out with streets, blocks, and neighborhoods: \\n\\nAnyway, I thought this might be an interesting AMA, so go for it.\\n\\n**UPDATE:** Here is a link to a gigapan image of Burning Man at night while the man burns: \",\n",

One day he decided to quit the company to start his own project(web based). Besides working in the same company I used to help him in his project development &amp; I was more like moral support to him. He used to praise me about my support, my creative skills, my passion towards Entrepreneurshsip &amp; we became very close. After a year I too decided to quit the company to join in his project in the marketing field &amp; he was very happy about it. He made an oral commitment that we both will share 40% of profits each &amp; 20% goes to his uncle who was an investor to his project. At that time I never concentrated much on legal things as I wanted to help him build the product.\\n\\nWhen I joined him, the project was still under development- he was in the technical field doing coding &amp; I was in the marketing. After a month or so things started getting bad between us. He never used to like my work, my skills &amp; he used to show his frustration on me on whatever I do. He used to underrate me about not knowing technical skills &amp; I used to get hurt really bad. Even if I wanted to learn technical skills he wouldn\\'t let me do that saying \"you cannot learn it\". Not knowing what to do I used to do all kind of crap work in his project &amp; after 10 months when the project was about to go live, we had an argument again &amp; this time he criticized me very badly about my work. So finally I decided that I need to quit working for his project &amp; that decision did not bother him at all. When I asked him about the compensation, as I had invested some money which I saved during my job days, he refused to pay it saying I did not deserve anything. This time I scolded him very badly about his integrity, morality &amp; loyalty. Finally I quit his project &amp; for the next 2 months I could not do anything as I got really depressed. I lost money, time &amp; in the eyes of the people I am an idiot. Now I have started to work out on everything, building technical skills, working on my self-esteem &amp; looking for a job. \\n\\nNow he launched his project &amp; sends me an email once every two weeks to sign up for his website. I don\\'t want to think about him at all but when he sends me an email I get depress again &amp; will waste 2 days on it thinking about the past.

Also this recipe involves the hot spice cayenne peppers, I very much encourage you to try and find your perfect amount.\\n\\nThe following are the amounts for one serving:\\n\\nINGREDIENTS:\\n\\nFor the sauce:\\n\\n* 1 garlic clove\\n\\n* 1/2 cube of concentrated vegetable soup or 1 teaspoon of veggie bovril\\n\\n* 3 whole dried cayenne peppers or 1 teaspoon of powdered cayenne peppers\\n\\n* 1 spoon of wheat flour\\n\\n* 1 teaspoon of paprika (If you can get your hands on Spanish pimentón de la Vera it's even better, and actually the original spice).\\n\\n* 1 glass of water\\n\\n* 100g fried tomato sauce\\n\\n* 1 spoon of oil\\n\\nFor the mayonnaise:\\n\\n* 1 egg\\n\\n* 1 teaspoon of balsamic vinegar\\n\\n* 100 ml Extra Virgin Olive Oil\\n\\n* salt\\n\\nOf course, 1 big potato.\\n\\nPREPARATION:\\n\\nPeel and chop the potato in chunky pieces of around 2cm. Boil the potato in salty water (not all the way through as if to make potato mash) and then deep fry it in your oil of choice.\\n\\nWhile the potato is boiling you can prepare the sauce. In a frying pan pour about a spoonful of oil and heat. Finely chop the garlic clove and add it to the warm oil and stir until golden. If you are using whole cayenne peppers, add them with the garlic. A bit before the garlic is golden, add the half cube of concentrated soup or bovril and melt it a bit (it's not necessary to melt it all the way), shortly after, add the flour and fry it. Add the paprika or pimentón,  and the cayenne pepper if you're using powder. Mix well and add the water and the tomato sauce. Stir until it has a quite dense texture.\\n\\nThis is the recipe so far, mix the potatoes with this sauce after frying them.\\n\\nPersonally, I like to add some mayonnaise to this recipe, so this is how I make it:\\n\\nIn the blender cup add, in this order, the egg, a pinch of salt, the balsamic vinegar and the oil. Put the blender all the way down and slowly bring it up, mixing all the ingredients.\\n\\nImportant note on the mayonnaise:\\n\\n* First, this is a tricky sauce, if you've never made it before, it may take some tries before you get it right. Also, blending for too long can turn the mayonnaise into butter.\\n\\n* Second, this amounts have a little less oil than it usually takes to make normal mayonnaise, this makes the resulting sauce have a softer texture, more of a dense liquid than the normal texture of industrial mayo.\\n\\n* Last, and most important, making mayonnaise with balsamic vinegar and olive oil gives it a VERY STRONG TASTE, it may not be of the liking of everyone. Also, that taste fits this recipe very well, but it is not very good for other common uses of mayonnaise where we would want a softer flavour.\",\n",

Not answering emails, ignoring messages via IM.\\n\\nI know, what I did might seem stupid. It can make me look like a psycho one wouldn\\'t want to know. I could ask on of her friends for her phone number of current address, but that may put me in even worse position - I don\\'t want that.

Checking in here every day as a regular habit can and will help!\\n\\nSo I dug out a sex addiction book (it was more general than just porn addiction) that I'd bought when I quit.  One of the exercises in it is to write out a behavior chain that describes the slow incremental slide to a regression of behavior that occurs when you are trying to quit that behavior.  I'll share with you guys what I had written down.\\n\\n* Woke up feeling aroused\\n* Thought about how good it felt looking at porn\\n* Felt guilty and thought I should be strong\\n* Saw something suggestive on TV\\n* Looked it up online because it wasn't porn\\n* Thought I wanted to see something more explicit\\n* Told myself it wouldn't really hurt anyone\\n* Thought I'd make it quick and be done\\n* Looked at porn and started to masturbate\\n\\nBy identifying this typical chain I was giving myself lots of opportunities to break the chain when I recognize it beginning.  So what you're going to do (even if it's just in a temporary text editor, but better if you write it out or print it) is write out a typical behavior chain for yourself and then think about ways between each step that you can break that chain.\",\n",

But then, there are some signs she\\'s cheating. She disappears, and we find out she ran off with some guy. She comes back six months later in debt and asks for forgiveness, says she\\'s changed. He pays off her debts, which takes about half his savings. She then makes him go on a \"second honeymoon,\" to the Bahamas, calling him unromantic when he cites their financial situation. Then, just as his savings have reached a low, they realize his company might lay him off. She divorces him shortly after. She ran off with some of his money, and leaves him emotionally broken. His work performance is affected, and he loses his job. He\\'s a wreck for a year until he starts to pick things up and gets a new job (but the pay is not as good). He even starts dating again. Since he\\'s a good looking, nice guy, he quickly meets a girl. I\\'m relieved because she seems like a good person. But then his ex-wife comes back (again carrying some debt), wanting to start things up again. He tells her about his new relationship, but she tells him how much she still loves him, how much it was all a mistake, how he shouldn\\'t give up what they had. She convinces him to break up with his new girlfriend, who is crushed. At first the ex-wife doesn\\'t want to get married, so they have been dating for 6 months. My friend now works a 12 hour job. He seems much more stressed now, but he tells me the money is worth it, since his previous job wasn\\'t as good as the one he was laid off from. I can\\'t be sure his ex-wife pressured him to get this job, but they got engaged pretty quickly after he was hired.\\n\\nI and some other friends have told him over and over how bad and unfair this is and will be, but the thing is, this friend doesn\\'t really think what his ex-wife did was all that unfair. He\\'s cool and laid back. He never gets mad or retaliates when someone hurts him, just lets it happen. Sometimes he gets really broken (when she divorced him), but he still keeps the people who did it close to him. He doesn\\'t seem to defend himself by avoiding bad people. He\\'s never avoided bad friends, coworkers, and in this case, women.\\n\\nHow do I help him?\\n\\n**Edit:** Thank you for your replies Reddit. You made me realize that I need to mention: This woman has a magnetic personality and is very convincing with words. Words and people are her forte, unfortunately. She also has a way of making unfair things sound justified. (i.e. tossing away a friend who\\'s going through a really hard time turns into \"I think it\\'s fair to give myself space from someone I\\'m uncomfortable with.\" The more she says, the more you think it\\'s the friend\\'s fault, not hers.) Who knows how reasonable she sounds to him? I think this is really the thing that\\'s making him believe her over everyone else. \\n\\nTwo friends confronted her after the divorce. They found out that she rationalized and justified her actions. For example, she seemed convinced that she wasn\\'t wrong to divorce him when his savings were low (due to her debt) and risked losing his job because \"it was a healthy financial and mental decision for her.\" But she did seem really bothered when accused of being amoral and selfish. She tried hard to justify her actions, and said they were being small minded by judging her based on smaller bits in the past and not believing in her ability to be a better person.\\n\\nSo, not only is she able to convince my friend she\\'s justified, she\\'s able to rationalize her own actions.',\n",

Although I make fun of it most of the time, it really is bothering me lately (as in last few years). I would even go as far as saying it\\'s not about being a virign and having sex but I want a soulmate, a partner. I want someone to cuddle in the evening.\\n\\nI can\\'t say for sure but I think being lonely all the time severly impacts my life. It just feels like I can\\'t go on with it (as in, I don\\'t know, grow up, behave like a man) as long as this elemental part is missing. I\\'m stuck in my usual routine, do stupid things on weekends, struggle with when I sleep or get up, don\\'t really have motivation for university etc. My morale isn\\'t really high and I\\'m rather chaotic.\\n\\nI always try to analyze my situation, where does this come from and I\\'m pretty sure I know. I was born cross-eyed (like really cross-eyed). Had a surgery when I was small with little effect. This lead to me being cross-eyed for my whole life up to the age of 20, where I had another surgery with way better results. It isn\\'t perfect, but more on this later. Being cross-eyed made me become a stupid computer nerd. It\\'s not like I didn\\'t have friends or did stuff outside (I did skateboarding for example, so I might count as cool back then) but in the end, I spent my whole teenage life doing anything but hitting on girls. When I turned 18, I started going to clubs and get drunk and the usual stuff, but still, no real attempts at getting to know girls. It feels like the 20 years really have scarred me.\\n\\nI\\'ve no idea wether I\\'m attractive or not (friends tell me I\\'m alright but they\\'re friends, what else are the supposed to say). I\\'m not really tall (Warning: Metric unit ahead: 1.75m) and really skinny. So I\\'m not really manly. Being skinny seems to be a result of my stupid metabolism. I myself would be the tall strong manly man but I\\'m quite the opposite.\\n\\nNow that my eyes are rather fixed, I thought I might change and eventually become the person I alaways wanted to be, but it just won\\'t work. I think I have a rather low self-esteem and talking to strangers is hard for me. Eye contact seems to be the key in approaching girls, and I just can\\'t do it. Not just with girls but all strangers basically. The standard trick for this kind of problems (I\\'m very shy) is getting boozed up. And in fact, about every weekend I\\'m drunk beyond good and evil. And still, there\\'s not a single moment between sober and passing-out-drunk where I\\'d have the courage to talk to girls, I just can\\'t do it.\\n\\nRegarding the partying: I guess this is where everyone else gets to know girls, but I don\\'t. Even when I see someone attractive my stupid brain starts working and goes like \"What to say?\", \"Is this going to be a one-night stand? You have no experience\", \"What will be the result? What if she tries to kiss you if you talk to her, you have no clue about it\" and stuff like that. Plus, I yet have to experience the feeling of girls being attracted to me. Friends sometime tell me some girl might like me but I don\\'t believe them, I didn\\'t register it myself.\\n\\nA bit more about me: I\\'m anything but the boring shy-in-the-corner guy. As I said, I go out every weekend, get drunk, dance like a maniac. I am a DJ myself, which should give me some coolness points. I dress decently and I don\\'t smell or anything like that. My outward appearance is important to me.\\n\\nSo to come to an end on this post: I think it\\'s all about my insecurity and I have no idea what to do. Even being drunk doesn\\'t help me. Any tips on how to handle this? Should I get professional help (I considered it)? How to improve my self-esteem? How to find a girlfriend?',\n",

       " 'What do you guys think separates us from the rest of the animal kingdom? What can humans do that other animals cannot?\\n\\nI took a \"Theory of Human Uniqueness\" class at my university. The theory states that the most unique human ability is our elite throwing skill. No other animal can throw an object as well as a human. Our big brains, our ability to cooperate with the non-kin, our ability to afford to take years to bring up our young are all the outcome of our elite ability to throw.\\n\\nThe name of my professor was Paul M. Bingham and this is his theory:\\n#Human_evolutionary_biology\\n\\n\"He has developed the theory further in a self-published book, Death from a Distance and the Birth of a Humane Universe (BookSurge, 2009). This work builds on W.D. Hamilton’s theory of kin selection (Benefit x Relatedness &gt; Cost) and posits that the Homo genus evolved when an ancestral organism developed the ability to effectively manage non-kin conflicts of interests by lowering the cost of coercion between non-kin individuals (Benefit &gt; Cost of Coercion + Cost of Cooperation).\\n\\n...\\n\\nAccording to his theory, the cost of coercing a cheating individual in a cooperative effort, otherwise known as the free-rider problem, was lowered when a precursor species to modern humans developed a way to threaten adult con-specifics from a distance by evolving the ability to throw. This diffused the risk to the predator formulated by Lanchester\\'s Square Law. It proposes that we evolved the ability to repel predators and scavenge their kills in the African savannah. This was later adapted as threat projection towards free-riding con-specifics in non kin cooperative groups.\"\\n\\n\\nI can\\'t really summarize a semester\\'s worth of information in this post.

I pull up next to a van DECKED OUT in BYU stuff...here we go, I thought. Not only did I see the couple inside with their BYU sweatshirts on buying Pepsi (not caffeine free) but also a family of 6 completely dressed in church attire obviously coming home from church (and in Utah its pretty much a sure bet they are mormon and not some other religion that doesnt teach not buying or working on sun) all buying a treat, dad with 2 pepsis in hand-again not caffeine free. Mind you there is the occasional \"Ox in the Mire\" situation, however if this were the rare case for this family where they were about to run out of gas and they were living the faith and being an example for their kids they would not all be in there buying a treat. Not to mention, now that I am out of the church, I see this ALL THE TIME on sunday, because when I was a faithful member I DIDN\\'T GO TO THE STORE ON SUNDAY LIKE A GOOD LITTLE MORMON!\\n\\nThis and other member related hypocrisies was the beginning of my questioning the church.

Yeah they were supposedly writing the word of God but if such a large number of members can\\'t even keep simple rules why would I trust them with huge important tasks that I base my whole earthly and eternal life on?\\n\\nWhen I was in the church I can say with confidence that I was near perfect as a church member. I attended church every week, didnt buy or work on sunday, held family home evening, did my visiting teaching, encouraged my husb to do all of his duties, went to the temple regularly, brought meals to people, held callings and fulfilled them well, prepared my lessons, paid tything, didnt swear, lived word of wisdom, didnt hike my garments up to suit my immodest clothes, read my scriptures, prayed, taught my kids the gospel, was honest in my dealings with my fellow men, didnt steal (including coiping CDs and DVDs which many so called good mormons do), etc, etc, etc!\\n\\nI didnt join the church because my family were members. I joined at 14 on my own because I wanted to live what the gospel taught and be surrounded by a group of people who also did the same. I can leave room for small error once in a while but as time progressed I saw through the facade that many many mormons wear and lost more and more faith in the people and their religion as my disappointment grew and grew until i was so let down and sad that I decided looking within for faith, morality, and goodness in the universe was more effective and fulfilling than being a part of a group whose founders had a lot of good and wholesome ideas bundled up with their own human bullshit.',\n",

       " 'I had this idea recently after my parents spent a good 6 months going to offices, soliciting bids, and getting quotes for several different remodeling projects in our home. My idea was to try and consolidate this process. while using some basic economic principles to attempt to benefit the consumers, as well as the contractors who perform the job. My idea was an eBay-similar site, where people would post a job they needed done, and various contractors would bid on that job, similar to how big government contracts are auctioned off. The competition would certainly benefit those who need the job, and the contractors would benefit by having major sources of work posted on the site. I talked about it with my parents and they had several criticisms which I gave additional ideas to solve. \\n\\nFirst Problem : How do you make sure bids are from real Contractors?\\nMy Answer : Well, to be able to bid on the site, you would have to be approved by the site as a real contractor, and as you use the site, the reviews from the jobs carried out have to meet a certain positive ratio for them to continue bidding. \\n\\nSecond Problem : A lot of times contracting jobs need an in depth inspection before a quote can be given.\\nAnswer : For those particular jobs, an \"open house\" can be held, where registered contractors who are interested are given a time and date where they can all inspect a particular site. Then, at a certain time after the \"open house\", bidding begins.\\n\\nThe bids would not be binding like ebay. Contractors could include additional information about their bid and why it should be chosen ahead of the others. This information would be public to all other bidders. After bidding closed, the poster would have time to mull their options and choose a contractor. \\n\\nAnyone else think this idea is good? I know it isn\\'t the next big internet thing/multi-million website, but can it get off the ground? If you are really interested, I\\'d need help starting it up, I\\'m only 16, and my only programming/web design experience is the AP Comp Sci AB course and designing my club\\'s website. We\\'d need regional managers to register the contractors in metropolitan areas, as well as a lawyer to draw up the incorporation and terms of service. An idea to get the company started would be to distribute information to local Realtors, who would get a small commission for getting their clients with recently purchased homes or homes to be sold to use the site. \\n\\nThanks ahead of time, reddit!',\n",

The discharge is usually from the left eye and is usually a greyish or whitish mucus, though sometimes it is yellow/green.  Along with here running eyes she also sneezes a lot.  \\n\\nWe brought her to a local vet 2 weeks ago where she was 9.9lbs and had normal lungs and temperature.  No blood work or xrays were done then.  We were told that due to the lack of eye scars and ulcers it was not feline herpes. Even though her symptoms are directly in line with feline herpes.\\n\\nThe doctor gave her a steroid shot of prednisone as well as two antibiotics(one liquid by mouth and one eye drip).  He also have us 2mg tablets of prednisone to spilt in half and give 2x a day.\\n\\nWe followed the recommended charge and for the first week she still sneezed and still had discharge but it was severely decreased from the normal amounts.  About one exact week after the prednisone shot her eyes started to discharge a lot more and she got kinda blue.  We kept with the antibiotics and the prednisone tabs and then a week after that she got really bad.  This was 3 days ago, she then became extremely congested and didn't even eat or drink for two days.\\n\\nYesterday(Sunday the 3rd of the extreme congestion) night we had trouble giving her her prednisone tablet, so we broke it up and put it in sardine juice but she didn't really eat it.  we then took the juice in a baby dropper and have it to her that way, but cant really be 100% sure she got the prednisone(1mg).  Though right before this we gave her sardines and some water and she started to be herself.  The extreme congestion cleared up and she really was good.  Then overnight she got a little more blue, but still much better then those 2 last days.\\n\\n\\nToday Monday we went to the vet and he took blood and a xray.  Lungs and temperature were normal.  Xray was also completely clean.  Blood tests showed slight leukopenia as well as low levels of creatinine.  Like I said both were not extremely low but low enough for the doctor to take concern. \\n\\nMy doctor now wants to run thousands of dollars worth of tests and we are just a but unsure.   My cat was much better both physically, mentally and emotionally before we went to see the vet.  We expected Herpes or allergies, but now the doctor is talking about  lymphoma.\\n\\nI am interested in some other vets takes on this situation, and are low on funds.  The current visits have just about made us broke, and I hope we don't have thousands of dollars left to spend.  \\n\\n\\nI really hope somebody can reply and help me with this, Id really appreciatelymphoma it.\",\n",

       " 'When people talk about Bioshock, usually the word immersive is thrown around a lot. I defiantly felt that when I played it. The world, characters, and gameplay all came together for a tremendous experience. The list assumes after your first play through, not on repeats. As we all know, any game you play more than once, loses some of the wonder it has.\\n\\nHowever, after playing through the first Metroid Prime, I can say that Bioshock\\'s immersion pales in comparison to MP. It can be broken down as follows:\\n\\n1. Character: Bioshock is a FPS, so you automatically feel like you are the character. That is about as far as it goes, though. In MP, on the other hand, you are Samus. You\\'re in her helmet, you see what she sees, you react as if you are Samus. You scan, shoot, jump, dodge all as if it is really you. There really is no comparison when it comes to feeling like the character.\\n\\n2. World: I will say that Bioshock has a incredibly detailed world that is done incredibly well. However, i felt the locations started to feel kind of the same after a while. \"Ooh, another water drenched hallway...yawn\". MP\\'s world is also very detailed and well done, but the big difference is that there is different areas that feel different, but come together in the end. You have a lava cavern under the surface, chozo ruins above, an arctic area, and a mining area. All of these areas work together to make the planet believable, but feel different every time you step off an elevator. \\n\\n3. Weapons: I will concede here and say that shooting lightning and fire from your hands is awesome. MP has great weapons, but the sheer awesomeness of Bioshocks powers help edge this ahead.\\n\\n4. Exploration: The only reason to explore in Bioshock is to find recordings and the usual FPS fare (money, ammo, etc). In MP, you want to explore. You need to see every square inch of the world to find every expansion for missles, power bombs, and energy. You want to explore just to see the world that waas made and to experience every nook and cranny.\\n\\nSo there you have it. I can still appreciate Bioshock, but when it comes to full immersion in a video game, Metroid Prime is king (or queen, Samus is a girl you know)',\n",

       " \"Some recent reading has really got me thinking about consumerism, and just the amount of time, energy, and resources that are wasted in the big treadmill that comes out of it.  But my thinking has gone deeper into why consumerism has come about in the first place, and as a result, I'm finding that I'm questioning if it's possible for capitalist economies to get out of the cycle of consumerism?\\n\\nThat's what I'm questioning here - is it possible for a capitalist society, in an environment of plenty*, to exist without falling into consumerism?  I can't imagine it any other way.  Humanity has become so efficient at using resources to provide the basics for everyone that only a small percentage of people are involved in doing so.  Thus we have a large percentage of people who are able to work, but are not needed to provide for everyone else - but as we're a capitalist society, those people need to work to make the money to buy the things they require to survive, so they then have to make and provide things and services that aren't needed.  These then have a need to be sold to people, and so on.\\n\\nIn other words, it looks like that because we've chosen an economy that requires people to buy the necessities of life with money, as if they're scarce resources, then we need to find reasons for everyone to work to earn that money.  People are pushed to consume to make sure that others get paid to produce, just because that's the only way that most people can have the jobs they need to stay alive.  If the majority of people were to stop all that excess consumption, it seems like our economy would fall apart, with masses of people out of work, because we've come to depend on an economy of consumption.\\n\\nAm I wrong here?  I'd really be interested in seeing how capitalism could work without this reliance on consumption - and even better if there are ideas as to how to get there.\\n\\n\\n(*I want to call out the environment of plenty, because it does seem that a society where the work of everyone is required just to provide enough for everyone to live, would end up not being consumerist, because there isn't room for it.  I don't know, however, if such a state is stable.  But that's not what I'm really interested in here.)\",\n",

We cooked it up two days ago, and right now, it\\'s in the primary fermenter (a glass carboy) with the waterlock (I think that\\'s the word for it) bobbing away.  However, there\\'s a solid inch-thick layer of foam and crud on top of the beer!  It looks very thick and persistent with small bubbles, like sea-foam, and there\\'s bits of hops and shit stuck in it.  I was just wondering if this is normal (to have thick, small-bubble foam on top), or if maybe I messed up by cooking it wrong, allowing contamination, adding ingredients at the wrong stage, etc.\\n\\nIt\\'s an amber ale made from a kit (one can of malt extract syrup, and two bags of powdered malt extract).  We added 1 oz of hops at the beginning of the boil, and another near the end, as well as some orange zest about 25 minutes in (an experiment), and boiled it for ~35 minutes.  We didn\\'t have a pot quite big enough for the recipe (we had a 6.6L pot for 1.5 gallons of water) so we split the boil between two pots and then recombined in the big pot after some of the water evaporated.  We didn\\'t filter between the boil and the primary fermenter (I think this may be the problem), thinking we\\'d just siphon it through a filter into the secondary fermenter.  Another potential problem: we didn\\'t take the temperature of the wort before adding yeast, but it seemed \"cool enough\" - however, the beer is fermenting nicely so the yeast seems happy enough.  We made sure to sterilize the shit out of everything (with C-Brite), but maybe we messed up (though as a biology student I\\'d feel bad if my sterile technique weren\\'t up to snuff).\\n\\nShould I be worried about my first batch of ale?  Have you guys ever had nasty foam, and did it make your beer taste bad?  Is it contaminated and should I start over?  \\n\\nHopefully this is normal, and I\\'ll have a great batch of hoppy, orangey (maybe even orangered) ale in a month!

       " 'My girlfriend and I have a really strong relationship (as in we tell each other everything).  We\\'ve been together 9 months. One night were were watching porn to set the mood.  The guy in the vid had a huge penis.  I\\'m about average, maybe a little below average compared to the tapes we watch, and anyway I jokingly said if she wanted to do something like that we could arrange it.  I was kind of joking but she had mentioned a few times that she wouldn\\'t mind if I was an inch or so bigger.  Remember we tell each other every thing so this stuff comes up often. \\n\\nFast forward a few months later to new years eve.  We were at a friends house party and everyone was getting pretty lit.  A few of the local college basketball players were there too, so naturally the girls were acting super trampy which was pretty sexy.  Making out w/ each other etc.  My GF even made out w/ another girl sometime after the new years kiss.\\n\\nSo it\\'s around 2am and I\\'m ready to go and start trying to find her.  I get to one bedroom and do a quick peek in. At first I didn\\'t believe it so I stepped all the one into the room.  There was my girlfriend still wearing her shirt while one of those basketball player douche bags was thrusting her.  I thought she might be getting raped so I stepped to him and she\\'s like \"no no it\\'s ok dave don\\'t make him stop\" or something like that.  Then this asshole had the nerve to tell me to shut the door.  I glanced down to see a fairly massive penis thrusting my girlfriend again.  He wasn\\'t wearing a condom.  I was feeling empty.\\n\\nSo I sat outside the room listening in shock almost crying as my gf got fucked for a few more minutes.  On the cab ride home she explained that she thought it was my fantasy.  And I guess since we talked about it I really have no right to be mad.\\n\\nFast forward to present.  I\\'ve caught my girlfriend having sex with this guy around 6 more times.  One time they even started while I was in the room and tried to get me to watch the whole thing.  I don\\'t even know what to say anymore.  I told her that it was weird and she was like \"sometimes fantasy makes us feel uncomfortable.\"\\n\\nI alrdy told her it was ok so I would be a hypocrite if I made her stop now.  I also told the dude to kindly not come over anymore and he pretty much said that he would come over if she invited him.  \\n\\nMy question I guess is: How do I handle this?  I want my GF to be happy and it hurts me to know I can\\'t satisfy her sexually like this guy can.  On the other hand, she should want me to be happy also right?  Am I an asshole for saying it\\'s ok for her to have sex with a larger male, and then change my mind?\\n\\n-Dave',\n",

Some games like Half-Life involve great set pieces and wowing the player with a lot of action, great story and an immersive atmosphere.

If it's really moldy but still structurally intact for the most part, is there enough THC in there to make this worthwhile?\\n* Would it be better to use alcohol to bind the THC first?

       " 'I know it\\'s not the \"done\" thing to be openly hostile towards Islam, that at some point our culture decided that the best way to deal with an ideology that is diametrically opposed to our notions of freedom of speech, life and liberty was to never say anything to it that may be mildly upsetting. But I\\'ve found Muslim apologists to be on the whole far more obnoxious, illogical and hateful than their Christian counterparts. Perhaps a lifetime of hearing the same diatribe of nonsense from Christians has immunised me to it, and to hear Islam is like learning to deal with a pain in your left leg only for the pain to appear in your right. Sure it\\'s the same pain except in a different place, but it\\'s still a pain in the ass you don\\'t want to have to deal with. They are overtly dismissive and unresponsive to criticism. They outright declare any forms of deviancy from expected ideas of Islamic thinking as automatically invalid. The advocacy of the prospect of Islam conquering the world and Muslim\\'s becoming the Master Race both disturbs me and makes me enraged to my very core. \\n\\nAcceptance is one thing but when a group of people is actively making it clear that they are rubbing their hands in glee at the real-life prospect of complete control over their fellow human beings, well that ticks me off a little bit. I can throw away concepts like Evangelicals waiting for the Rapture because I know it\\'s nonsense. But when someone talks about having direct control over the world like some kind of gaggle of Bond-villains, all the while practically wallowing in their own sense of superiority, even the most open-parts of my mind want to shut themselves off faster than an Anderson shelter in an air-raid. Nothing in Islam is appealing to me, the Quran is filled with contracted rants about the glory of Allah and the sub-human nature of non-believers. I don\\'t want to hate this religion, I realise that there is cultural and historical significance in the expansive Islamic culture. But as it stands every Muslim I have spoken to has made me despise Islam more and more until I\\'m now at a point where I can no longer contain my anger at their practices and thoughts.\\n\\nSo does this have a point? Not really, I suppose most of you will be vicious and thorough in your demolition of my position. Such is par for the course on this website. But I just wanted to put it out there for you all to comment on; I hate Islam, and it\\'s Muslims who are to blame. Not through terrorism or anything like that, just by making their religious faith seem like a cancer of the mind.\\n\\nEDIT: I\\'ll clarify that I do have a number of Islamic friends. The anonymity of the Internet therefore gives me something of a condensed, Islamic-based presentation of these people I encounter.

Maybe I refused to admit it, but all those years of emotional abuse, during my childhood created psychological trauma. I grew up as if I didn\\'t exist and I did fell like a ghost sometimes. I\\'m not posting here to complain about my past or anything, I just hope I will be able to encourage people. I had countless moments where I fell it would be easier to just give up and die. When I was 20, I just wanted to be \"normal\", I tried therapy and I read theory as if knowing the theory would be enough to heal myself. Then, I became comfortably numb again for more than 5 years. I refused to try anything that could improve my situation because I was tired of all my past failure. I switched from one college degree to another for too long and then, I ended up in graphic design simply because I was too tired to do anything else and I couldn\\'t even believe I could do something involving anything more than this. Then, last year I saw a glimmer of hope because I finally realized I was able to help people through volunteer work (suicide hotline). All my hopes were bases on the assumption that I would start a bachelor degree in social work but then, I failed again and I ended up looking for jobs. I had a series of failures while I was looking for a new job too. I worked for one weeks then I was told I had a lack of self confidence and things would have to change if I wanted to keep that job. I just told them I wanted to leave because I thought I couldn\\'t fit in there and anyway, I wouldn\\'t want to stay in an office job. They agreed and I got back on unemployment insurance but I just fell like a total retard trying desperately to do something good of his life. I was so desperate that I can\\'t remember how often I thought of suicide. There was just one thing keeping me alive, I wanted to go all the way through the end of my suffering and I wanted sweet revenge on those who caused emotionals abuse when I was young. Those things are still the main driving force pushing me and allowing me to believe I can still try something even if I sent countless number of curriculum vitae with no answer and those few times, I got an interview, I didn\\'t receive any positive feedback. I also had a discussion with my mother and I just found out she had to go through the same suffering 16 years ago. I couldn\\'t believe what she told me, she had a plan with a precise way to do it, all because of the same stupid sect which caused so much pain in my family.',\n",
       " \"So I was summoned for jury duty this morning, and when the lot of us got into the courtroom, the charges against the defendant were read, and, while complicated and filled with legalese, amounted to several drug possession charges. No robbery, no assault, no violence, no intent to sell (as far as I could tell). \\n\\nGenerally, I have no aversion to jury duty - I served as a juror in a weapons possession trial several years ago, and found it quite interesting, if not tedious at times. Being an engineer, I relished the chance to apply my analytical abilities to a non-technical problem. But when I heard the charges read in this case, I knew I could not in good conscience ever vote to convict this defendant. \\n\\nSee, I'm one of those folks who opposes the War on Drugs. I see it not as an attempt to limit the use of dangerous substances, but rather an attempt to jail as many poor people as possible while employing as many law enforcement personnel as possible. Taking a cue from the writing staff of The Wire (see this article:  ), I decided a couple of years ago that I would never vote to convict a defendant of non-violent drug-related charges if asked to serve on such a jury. \\n\\nWhen the court read the charges today, I wondered: Would the prosecutor even think to ask if I had moral objections to drug laws? I doubted it. Eventually, the judge said that anyone who had issues that might impede them from being an impartial juror in the case (like knowing the defendant, for example) should approach the bench and explain their issue. So I did. I politely told the judge that I felt the War on Drugs as carried out in America is morally wrong, and that I had vowed some time ago to engage in jury nullification if asked to serve on a jury for a trial involving only non-violent drug possession charges. The judge smiled, thanked me for my honesty, and excused me. \\n\\nCould I have had a greater impact by hiding my beliefs, getting on the jury, and hanging it (or convincing the jury to acquit)? Probably. But that seemed really dishonest to me; the court wanted impartial jurors, and I clearly didn't fit that bill in this case. Will the defendant be convicted anyway? Maybe. But I won't have played an active role in doing so, and that's what matters most to me.\\n\\nI'm sure some will think otherwise, but I'm not posting this because I want some silly, meaningless recognition from the denizens of my favorite news aggregation site. Rather, I simply want other Redditors who feel the same way I do about the drug war to know that this avenue of protest (if you could call it that) is open to them. I was not arrested, intimidated, or scorned in any way. I was not accused of shirking my civic duty, nor cajoled to reconsider. I genuinely felt that my opinion was respected. That being said, hopefully someday I'll get to serve on a jury again, when the defendant is accused of a genuine crime.\\n\\nEDIT: Thanks for all the insightful replies. It's clear to me now that I should have stuck around for voir dire, if only to get the chance to air my opinion in front of the entire jury pool in the hopes of tainting it. (*creates new file in mental Life Lesson directory*)\\n\\nEDIT2: Just to be clear, I was never on the jury. I was in a pool of about 150 potential jurors for a case needing 12 (+ 2 alternates). During selection, randomly drawn groups of 14 people are questioned by the attorneys, who can object to any potential juror for any reason (except race / ethnicity, etc.), stated or otherwise. Once enough jurors have been seated, selection ends, and the other potential jurors are dismissed. Therefore, not every potential juror is questioned.\",\n",

       " \"Sometimes when I'm sitting on a plane I think about this.  The closer you are to a gravitational object, the more highly time is dilated (if youre near a black hole, youre time slows down a LOT) So being high up, time should run slower for someone on the ground.  But you are also moving at around 500 miles per hours, so special relativity says time should slow down in the plane.  So which effect wins?  Does time slow down more than a person standing on the earth because of your velocity? or does time speed up in the plane because of their proximity to the surface of the earth?\\n\\nI finally found the answer, which is as follows.  The way you can calculate the effect of gravity to first approximation is to just consider an inertial frame on the airplane and let it fall.  Due to the equivalence principle, this is the same as letting starting a person at rest and accelerating them away from you and then a second observer accelerates past you (the guy on the ground as you fall).  YOu can calculate the speed when that person gets next to the 'falling' inertial observer by 1/2mv^2 = mgh and solving for v.  You get about 1000 miles per hour, double the horizontal velocity, so the gravitational effect is twice as strong as the special relativity effect.  \\n\\nSo in some respect, if you are standing on something higher up than someone else, you are traveling 'faster' than they are, even though both of you are standing still, because youre both in an accelerated frame of reference.\",\n",

       " 'It’s a glib explanation, but it doesn’t make sense to me, and here’s why. Crucial fact:\\n\\n* **Nothing prevents you from installing web apps on the iPhone without going through the app store.**\\n\\nThe widespread assumption, as I understand it, is that banning Flash forces developers to rewrite their SWFs as iPhone apps, which can then only be distributed on the app store after receiving explicit approval from Apple. Right?\\n\\nThe problem is, that only applies to “native” UIKit apps, because web apps have never been subject to this process of dictatorial control. And an HTML5 web app can do just about anything a Flash app can do (the only exception I know of is recording through the camera and mic, please correct me on this). It will usually do it faster and better, *and* it will install directly to the home screen just like anything from the app store. So if you’re porting a Flash app to the iPhone, you can avoid the approval process and charge whatever you like without giving a single penny to Apple. If you’re so inclined.\\n\\nOh, I know, HTML5+JS in WebKit wasn’t *always* as capable as Flash. If you had a Flash app a couple years ago you wanted to port to the iPhone, you might’ve needed UIKit for some things, and you’d have had to submit to Apple’s approval process and distribution scheme. But remember, the app store didn’t even *exist* for the first year after the iPhone was released. Every third-party application was supposed to be a web app running under WebKit (exactly like Google’s vision for Chrome OS, incidentally). Developers were supposed to target open standards like scriptable SVG and &lt;canvas&gt;, not UIKit or Flash.\\n\\nThat vision turned out to be premature, in 2007, because WebKit on iPhone OS 1.0 wasn’t quite up to the task. But now it’s 2010, WebKit and HTML have evolved, and you no longer need UIKit for the kind of animations and interactivity Flash provides. Moreover, on the desktop, the installed base of HTML5-capable browsers is growing. Software written to any device-specific API, including UIKit, is getting less relevant. So for the types of applications that use Flash, as well as many more complex apps, UIKit is already overkill and on the way out—do people think nobody at Apple realizes that?\\n\\nI’m not saying Apple doesn’t want developers writing for UIKit. The app store is profitable, for one thing, and the number of apps targeting UIKit provides a form of vendor lock-in. But here’s the specific point regarding Flash:\\n\\n* **Keeping Flash off the iPhone has nothing to do with skimming off profits from the sale of iPhone apps, because you are perfectly free to sell non-Flash apps without going through Apple’s app store.**\\n\\nI know Reddit as a whole has been suffering from collective retardation on this topic, but does that at least make sense to you folks?\\n\\n\\n***\\n\\nThings Flash can do that a web app can’t:\\n\\n* Camera and mic input\\n* Realtime DSP\\n* DRM\\n\\nWhat else?',\n",

The stranger, a male, suggested that they go out for food.  The student drove the stranger to a McDonald's in East Palo Alto.  The stranger then asked the student if he could crash at the student's residence. The student refused, so the stranger got out of the student's vehicle.  Unbeknownst to the student, the stranger left a bag of personal items in the student's car.  Upon discovering the bag, the student took it to the Stanford Police (on Monday, February 1) so that it could be returned to the stranger.  Among the items in the bag, the police located a pair of handcuffs and lighter fluid.  The officers were able to ascertain the identity of the stranger and, after some investigation, determined that the individual did not appear to pose a threat to the student or the community.  None-the-less, the Stanford Police would like to remind you to be wary of offering rides to people whom you do not know.\\n\\n\\nweird that this is a Stanford bulletin... guess they had nothing better to do today?\",\n",

Soon I continued this, passing the sacrament, becoming a teacher and a priest, and even entering the Holy Temple - all unworthily. I had tried to stop my addiction.

       " 'So last week I made a PayPal transaction that cost $18 with only $6 dollars in my bank account (I have two bank accounts one with BOA and the other is with RaboBank.  RaboBank is my Primary as I am living in the Netherlands.)  Anyways this left my account negative 12 dollars.  So they charged the $35 overdraft fee which would be expected - and hey it was my mistake so I was happy to own up to it.  But then PayPal decided to charge two separate transactions totaling 33 cents.  Well the account being negative now $47.00, one transaction for $0.25 and the other for $0.08 added another two $35 overdraft fees now bringing my total negative balance to $117.  But wait, apparently in June BOA decided to enact a new overdraft fee called an \"Extended Overdrawn Balance Charge\" which is another $35 fee in which isn\\'t caused because of a transaction posting but rather when the account is overdrawn more then 5 days.  So this brought my total account balance to negative $152.00 for going less then 13 dollars in the red.  This to me seemed not only outrageous but morally wrong (ever heard of usury?) \\n\\nSo I made the long distance call from the Netherlands to BOA\\'s 800 number and after a short hold was on the phone with a nice young lady who immediately advised after I mentioned what I was calling about that there is nothing she can do and could pass me to a supervisor - so I say ok no problem.  The supervisor gets on the phone with a very cold and uncaring attitude and gives me the same speech on how there is nothing they can do to return fees but I could request a call back from someone higher up which could take 24 to 48 hours.  I argue with her for about 5 minutes before realizing that they really could give a shit.  \\n\\nNow I am pissed.  Not because I don\\'t have money and cant afford the insane fees, but rather its become about principal.  So I get on the Google and start searching around forum posts to which I see tons of other people in way worse situations complaining about their customer service and the way that the BOA generally mistreats their customers.  While reading through a woman\\'s tragic tale of misfortune and some $1000 in racked up bank fees she posted this Gem **1-704-386-5687**  This number is to BOA executive support.  I called them, told them everything that happened and within 5 minutes I had $140 worth of overdraft fees returned - without hassle.  If anyone out there is getting killed by fees and has a legitimate excuse or hardship, this is the number to call, not the 800 number.\\n\\nI will say one last thing.  I plan on getting back to the US in June for a holiday.  The first thing I plan on doing is closing my BOA account and opening a account at my local credit union.',\n",

       " 'Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives have each had their own ideas of who to blame for the financial crisis.  Until tonight I\\'ve been on the Democrat\\'s/liberal\\'s side which says that there hasn\\'t been enough regulation of the banking industry.  My understanding of the financial crisis has been that it was a \"perfect storm.\"  Banks were handing out NINA(No Income No Assets) loans, selling them to other banks who then chopped them up and repackaged them as mortgage backed securities(MBS) with AAA ratings.  It was only a matter of time before people who had no job and no assets could not repay their mortgages, and it\\'s no surprise then that these types of activities eventually led to a crash.  \\n\\nUntil tonight I thought that these practices were allowed because nobody told banks not to do it, and banks were simply acting in their own(albeit short-term) interest.  But now I think I was wrong.  Fanny Mae and Freddie Mac were both organizations set up by the US government]( to encourage people to purchase homes.  Originally they were strictly a government organization, however eventually they were allowed to be publicly traded companies looking to make a profit, and they were not accountable to the SEC since they still enjoyed the backing of the federal government.  They used their ability to take out low interest loans to buy up mortgages from other banks, making a profit from the difference in interest rates and also by selling MBS.  This provided an incentive for other banks to hand out more mortgages since they could just sell them to Fannie and Freddie(Fannie/Freddie owned 90% of the mortgages on the market).  When people inevitably started defaulting on their loans, Fannie and Freddie [went under]( and the MBS\\'s lost their value.  This caused a cascade of [credit default swap(CDS) payments to be triggered since they had been purchased as a hedge for the MBS\\'s.  AIG supplied the largest share of CDS, and they simply could not pay out.  Banks lost all value of the MBS and the CDS hedge didn\\'t pan out causing the whole financial industry to teeter on the edge of collapse.\\n\\nSo, now I\\'m wondering how is this not directly the fault of our government for allowing Fannie and Freddie to exist in this way in the first place?  While the lack of regulation and transparent exchange of CDS\\'s is a problem and has gotten a whole lot of attention, it seems like it was far from the underlying problem which was actually handing out all these mortgages in the first place.  And since this is not happening anymore, haven\\'t we by and large removed the systemic risk?  If we have, I\\'m now wondering how big a deal this whole \"too big to fail\" business really is since they wouldn\\'t have failed if our government hadn\\'t allowed the mortgage bubble to happen in the first place.\\n\\nReddit, what are your thoughts on all of this?  There is a lot of anger out there directed at the banking sector, but now I can\\'t help but wonder if it\\'s very unfair to blame them given everything I\\'ve mentioned above.',\n",

       " 'I have read many refutations of the idea of qualia but I have yet to read one which mirrors my interpretation. I ask you, the browsers of r/phil to tell me if this argument has already been made or not and point me in the right direction if that is the case. \\n\\n&gt;\"Qualia\" is an impossibility. You cannot describe a sense in terms of another sense accurately. For example the test of qualia is to ask \"how would you describe the color red to a blind person\" the answer is you cannot. The reason for this is because the idea of the color red is learned through the specific sense of sight, not because it is a separate and unique experience between users.  \\n\\n&gt;There are specific phenomena which can only occur and be interpreted on specific biological sensors. For humans the only sensor which can detect light around a narrow spectrum called the visible spectrum is the eye. During the formative years people are taught that this particular phenomena is linked to a linguistic counterpart – the spoken word “red” or undoubtedly with “hot” which as it happens is so because the blackbody radiation spectrum of materials over a certain temperature is what we call both red and hot thus categorizing them.\\n\\n&gt;The idea of a color then is simply its correct categorization, just as all senses are. “Soft” for example cannot be mimicked nor can “loud” accurately in terms of other senses. Asking then how do you describe the color red to a blind man, is a non-sequitur. The material definition of the process is all there is to the process – not being able to translate that to others or to other senses is a result of their specialization and arguably a deficiency of our evolved communication methods.\\n\\nMind you I have read arguments which are similar in their simplicity and material basis, but none which make the argument that subjective qualia demands an impossible relationship and is thus based on fallacy.',\n",

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`. We recommend you start setting `weights_only=True` for any use case where you don't have full control of the loaded file.
