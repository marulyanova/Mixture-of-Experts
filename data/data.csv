The one feature the iPad is really missing.,"I don't care about the lack of camera. I never use the one on my MacBook, and even if I did the angle would be terrible on the iPad.

I don't care if third party apps can't run in the background. I don't listen to streaming music.

The one feature I want is User Accounts and a Guest Account. If this device is meant to be a coffee table computer, it needs to be able to accomadate multiple users.",apple

"I skipped bail, ran away, and never got caught. AM(A)A.","Long/short story, I went to work in the United States in the last 90s and was busted in a major drug raid. I risked up to lifetime in jail if caught since I was associated with so many crimes; at the bare minimum, said my attorney, I was looking at 7 years in jail, and much more likely more than this.

My attorney said I was in a lot of trouble. He was the first to bring it up. I did not want to lose 10, 15 or 25 years of my life in jail, especially at my age. Since I was not a United States citizen, I should simply skip bail and run away. And never come back.

My bail was initially supposed to be $300,000 but my attorney managed to get the judge to set a final bail of $100,000. He explained I was a trustworthy person, lawfully employed, who never did anything wrong and never committed any crime. He portrayed me as someone trustworthy and intelligent who could take care of his responsibilities. The judge agreed and decided on a very low bail, especially for the crimes I was accused of. I still did not have so much money and had to hire a bondsman, who agreed to cover my bail for $15,000. It took three days to manage to get the money to pay both him and my attorney (I had to pay my attorney, or he would have revealed my plan to authorities).

I got as much cash as I could, as quickly as I could, mostly pawning most of my stuff (even some stuff I was not done paying), and getting away with a simple bag. I had no passport (confiscated), but a few friends on the not-so-right side of the law. It costed me quite a bit, but I was able to take someone's identity long enough to make it back to a country next to mine, and then take a train to my country. I destroyed evidence and promptly reported to my government, got a new passport and, very quickly, a new job. I never came back to the United States or even thought about going back there.

Last time I heard about the people who were arrested along with me, they were all convicted, and in jail. I consider myself very lucky, and happy. I've been living for over 10 years now happily and freely. It's crazy to think I could have spent this last decade in jail. I consider couldn't even imagine what my life would have looked like had I been convicted. It's crazy to spend so much of your life in jail, all due to a stupid mistake. I don't make excuses for my crime, but I do smile thinking about it. I've never been extraded/harassed in any way or shape (not even from the bondsman). AMAA.",IAmA

How sure are we that there were never any intelligent dinosaurs?,"I'm posting this under a throwaway account so my friends don't learn how retarded I am by posing this question.

I was thinking the other day about how humans are responsible (either directly through hunting or indirectly through climate change/deforestation) for the extinction of a whole lot of species. If we keep growing at this rate, we'll have issues of overpopulation and maybe even a mass extinction, no? And intelligent humans have only been around for far less than a million years.

Secondly, 65 million years is a really, really long time. How long will it take for all remnants of human civilization to be erased from the earth? Thousands of years? Maybe a few million, at most? The World Without Us says that ""After 500 years all that would be left would be aluminum dishwasher parts, stainless steel cookware, and plastic handles."" How long until these legacies are also destroyed?

Third, we're still discovering new species of dinosaur on a pretty regular basis, aren't we? And if an ""intelligent"" dinosaur only existed for a short period of time before reaching overpopulation and going extinct, there would be pretty slim odds of fossilization, no? 

Finally, I'm not discussing a civilization that is exploring space and building computers. But could dinosaurs have existed that engaged in primitive agriculture or herding practices? Maybe even had a spoken language?",science
"I'm confused, is Obama for offshore drilling or not?","It seemed during his SOTU address he was for offshore drilling but repeatedly during his campaign he bashed Bush and McCain for their pro-offshore drilling stance...I've done a little of my own research and found his clip where he was saying no to offshore drilling  and I've got this quote from his SOTU address:

A point about fine-tuning of the universe,"Fine-tuning is often brought up by theologians as an evidence of God's existence.  I can respond to anyone who uses this argument in several different ways and I believe that you guys are able to do so too, but I have thought of this new (as far as I know) refutation (or explanation) some days ago and I thought I'd share it with you.

so Theologians would say that god is the reason why the constants of the universe are fine-tuned, but what if the constants are the way they are because they are only ""results"" of an underling mechanism of the universe.  A good example of my argument would be the mathematical constant pi, I think it is safe to say that if pi was different by only (10^-1000)% we would not have perfect circles in the universe.  Of course, as most of you would point out, circles (perfect ones to be exact) do not depend on the value of pi, it is pi that depends circles.  I hope I made it clear enough.",atheism

[Offer] Round 2: I'll transcribe a song for you on Guitar/Bass,"The first offer garnered a lot of responses so I thought I'd try again. I replied to a few requests in the comments and sent out about 10 tabs through PM's. Sorry if I didn't get to your song - there were way more requests than I could possibly keep up with. Feel free to re-request in here.

This time I'm going to simplify things. I will tab/transcribe the chords for any song that you can't find the music for online, but I'd like to stick with simpler songs. The idea behind this is to help novice musicians - I had some requests last time for intricate guitar solos, which says to me the person is either trolling or just too lazy to figure it out on their own so I'm not going to waste my time. If you can't figure out a 10 minute guitar solo on your own you probably won't be able to play it anyways, even given a tab.

That being said I will do my best to figure out the chords to any song you might like to play/sing along with. Last time I figured out some piano based music and transcribed it for guitar, and I am willing to do that again.

I have a basic exponential function a*b^t, and wanted to solve for when the integral of it matches a certain value, In other words:

    c = a/(t+1)*b^(t+1)

put in another form, the problem I'm basically trying to solve is:

    x = ab^x

The sound makes me think the garage is shaking.,"I have new carpet and seats to put in my 27 yo car.   Plush leather power seats and a nice new carpet that doesn't stink.  I put the engine in 8 years ago (twice the the HP, twice the torque)... replaced an in-line 4cyl with a corvette aluminum V8.

I quit drinking soda cold turkey. I'm on day 5.,"After reading this thread and the comments under it, I decided to stop drinking sodas as an attempt to begin living healthier. I kept the rules simple: drink nothing I consider to be a soda. Not the most precise way of going about it, but this included a carbonated, sugary drinks laden with HFCS and caffeine.

I was a total addict. I would drink about 3 or more cans a day of soda, usually Coke or Dr Pepper. I would feel shitty and upset until I got a soda at lunch, which would make me feel wonderful. I loved the way it tasted, I loved the way my lunch tasted with it. 

Even though I am skinny, I was afraid that if my metabolism started slowing down, so much soda meant I would quickly pack on weight. Also, with the ridiculous amounts of sugar, diabetes was always a scary but real danger. So I decided begin a healthy revolution for myself by not drinking sodas.

Day one went without incident. I grabbed a metal bottle and filled it with water, and this bottle has followed me throughout. I drank water for lunch and meals, but I wasn't particularly thirsty the whole day. I missed the taste of soda. I started getting a headache by the end of the day.

Day two was terrible. I was tired, and felt disconnected from reality.  I had a constant headache, and it got worse throughout the day. Anti-headache medicines could not fight my body's wrath at the sudden starvation of sugar and caffeine. In a desperate effort to stave off headaches, I got some coffee to see if my body would take the peace offering of caffeine through a medium that isn't soda. This made things worse, as soon I found myself shaking (as coffee usually makes me do) and I still had a headache. I shook myself to sleep.

Day three might have been the worst. My headaches from day two carried over, but were dulled a bit. Some excedrin kept them away for a bit. But while in my blessed excedrin-high, I decided to get some sexual release, and I was slammed with the worst headache of my life. I could feel this headache bearing down on the top of my head, like nothing I had ever felt before. I tried to sleep, but laying down didn't seem to stop this monster of a headache. I eventually got to sleep, and when I woke up, the typical dull headaches were back. My body was not happy with me.

Day four was better. I had even lesser headaches, and some advil seemed to end them one hundred percent. I started actually being thirsty for water, and not just drinking it at meals because I am American and I have to drink *something* at meals. I drank water and enjoyed it. As the night went on, my headaches seemed to go away.

And here I am, living through day five. I haven't had a headache today, and I've had my trusty metal water bottle by my side to keep me hydrated. I didn't talk to any doctors or nutritionists before doing this, and some redditors may find some things that I did very wrong, but I feel like I achieved my goal. I'm hoping as time goes on, I'll feel healthier. My eating habits aren't particularly stellar, but this is a good place to start.",Health

What does it mean when women play games at the start of a relationship?,"I met a great girl, asked her out, and we had an amazing first date. Super fun, lots of laughing, and I felt like we made a great connection. I mean it was one of the best first dates I had ever had. Now I think I must have totally misread the situation... (or blown it somehow, even though I haven't seen her since).

The problem is communication. Since that date she has barely responded to any of my attempts to talk to her. That doesn't seem like the behavior of someone who is interested in me. I don't think I have been over the top in my attempts either. I waited a couple days, tried calling her, no answer, tried emailing her, no answer, etc.

I ended up texting her as a last resort, saying something along the lines of ""I want to see you again, but I can't seem to get ahold of you.""

So finally she texts back saying she has been busy but we should get together again on the weekend. I reply and ask what she is up to on Sat night. She says she might have plans and she will let me know. Then she never even bothers to let me know. WTF! That's just rude. 

So what's the verdict? Lost cause or worth pursuing? I can never make sense of these games... and I don't know if I'm better off asking her what the deal is or just waiting for her to contact me.

[0] Something I've noticed when it comes to why r/Trees is better than r/Marijuana,"I'm subscribed to both Trees and Marijuana and I've seen this type of comment very often, whether it's because of a picture like the one in the link or just a stoner comment that someone decided to post. I find that it's really stupid to say stuff like that because whether we like it or not, the stoner stereotype exists. Pretending that it doesn't exist and insulting those who subscribe to the stereotype is detrimental to the marijuana community.

I don't understand what people who make/agree to those comments want in the world. Do they want every stoner to disappear from public? Are we supposed to reveal our marijuana use only if we're people with a disease that's alleviated by smoking weed? Wanting to do so is to want to twist reality and information, which is exactly what happened with marijuana when the government were/is trying to scare people away from it. Do they want this to happen again?

This is why I like Trees so much. We embrace the stoner stereotype and we're chill. I love you guuuuuuuuyyyyysss.",trees

Did the movie The Book of Eli piss anyone else off?,"So I saw this movie and even though it was predictable what it was about I was hoping for some sort of twist at the end. Pissed me off the ending did... here is how it went... 




*ATTENTION SPOILER ALERT IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW DON'T READ ANY FURTHER, you have been warned*

Okay so its in an apocalyptic world, I don't remember any explanation as to what caused the war but since they said people burned all the bibles I can only guess it was a religious war. Okay so you've got Eli, a loner traveling ""west"" who has the last fucking bible in the world(assumption) and it seems to make him a bad ass motherfucking soldier of god who seems immune to bullets almost. That alone is enough to piss me off, way to go asshole keep one of the most fucked up, hypocritical, terrifyingly nonsensical books alive to promote future delusion and bigotry. 

My friend stated that wasn't his intention that he wanted to do the opposite to keep its memory alive so that people can see the danger of such beliefs, but no its obvious that wasn't the message of the movie because the guy who memorized the fucking bible is the strongest, the most righteous person in the world. whats further annoying is the scene where Mila Kunis(damn shes hot but it was a bit of a turnoff seeing her in this character) so he teaches her about prayer and god a little bit, and her life seems to have more depth and meaning since. The antagonist who actually sees the bible for what it is, a tool of enslavement, I'm guessing hes the evil and stupid atheist aye. Oh and Eli turns out to be blind, dies at the museum where the fucker preserves the damn thing, and Solara I'm guessing is leaving to spread the message that or to my best guess to go save her mom.

An anecdote from someone new to beer snobbery,"Today I went the supermarket across the street from my apartment to get some beer, they have a surprisingly wide selection.  I remember seeing someone a week or two ago saying their Scottish (?) father always spoke poorly about American beers until he had a select few.  I remember seeing Arrogant Bastard Ale on the list of beers that turned him and discovered today it was sold by the pint at the supermarket (which is called Food Dimensions, by the way.)  So I bought one pint of it (it's a bit pricey) and a 6 pack of PBR pints because it's cheap and I like it.

The ABA was warm so I popped it in the fridge and drank one of the cold PBRs.  When I was done, I cracked open the Arrogant Bastard and *hot damn* that stuff is good!  Now I have 5 pints of PBR that taste like garbage by comparison.

So, /r/Beer, what are some other American brewed beers that can be found with relative ease?  I'm willing to try any variety.  If the list runs short on American beers start naming off some of your import (or export) favorites.

"Reddit, my husband won't have sex with me...","I've tried to work this out by talking to him, as well as just shrugging it off, and it has gotten me nowhere. Reddit, it's starting to take its toll on me, and I need advice on how to handle this.


Our relationship has been absolutely wonderful; There is 100% trust and honesty, we're completely in love and happy together, and up until about 5-6 months ago (we married 3 months ago), it was beautifully expressed in the bedroom. Frequently.


Our marriage was not consummated until days after our honeymoon (though I sure as hell tried). Also, it has been three weeks since our last sexual encounter and he has not once even *hinted* that he was interested in having sex with me. I really appreciate that he reminds me - several times a day, even - how attracted he is to me, but I need physical reassurance from him. When I hint, make gestures, or ask if he wants to have sex, he turns it down. We take showers together occasionally, and that never even seems to faze him. There's never a reason or excuse as to why. Sometimes he offers to give me oral instead, but I know it's out of guilt or pity, so I never agree. I won't enjoy it as much if it seems like a chore to him. When I'm feeling frisky, I'll give him head, but it's rarely reciprocated and it never leads to sex.

I am just stumped by this ""problem"". He's a healthy, happy 23 year old. He's not depressed or on any medication, and I know for a fact that he is not cheating on me. As I stated earlier, we have a very solid foundation. (if you're still skeptical: we recently moved to another state, so there is nobody to cheat on me with anyway.)

Even though I know how stupid this sounds, but the more he refuses, the more I feel as if he doesn't find me sexually appealing anymore. I've *always* been confident on my appearances, but to have my new spouse not want to touch me is pretty upsetting. Do you guys or girls have any idea what is going on here? Have any of you experienced this?



EDIT:: Thank you thank you thank you. Many of you have been extremely helpful. I will be giving a lot of thought into the advice I've been given.

I just want to clear up a couple things.

1) We had sex regularly before the marriage, up until a couple months before. We just hadn't made the marriage complete -hence consummated- until days days after the honeymoon.

2) Still. I stick by the no-cheating thing. I am unemployed, he has work a few times a week. Other than that, we are both home with each other. He doesn't spend time on a computer.. the only one we have is my laptop and he hardly uses it. If I were to ever doubt it, I know his passwords.

3) He's not gay. And I am not naive to this type of thing. Also: I have not gotten fat. I am 5'2 and ~100lbs. Nor is he a shallow person.

4) I will get to replying to some of you, but I have some errands to run.",relationship_advice

How should I approach my girlfriend about blowjobs?,"I feel really childish and selfish for asking this question, but the truth is that although I'm a 23 year old male who has been going out with my girlfriend since high-school began, I have yet to receive oral sex from her.

I found a job posting online for my current position. Any advice on how to handle this?,"A little background: In November I was hired into a non-management position at a salary about 5k less than I had been making at the job I got laid off from in September. The plan was for me to work with the current manager for 2 or 3 months after which she would leave the position to go back to school and I would be promoted to manager. I've actually got several years more experience than her so this seemed fine. I took the job. 

One day after I was hired she announced she would be leaving the company in 2 weeks. Instead of 3 months to train I had 2 weeks during the busiest time of the year for the company. The transition was a little rough but over the past month I've slowly been bringing some order to a system that was completely chaotic. Very few employees had been trained properly, equipment was all out of calibration, documents had errors in them, etc. 

I haven't been given any negative feedback on my job so far. In fact, on Friday they assigned 2 additional employees to work for me (so now I'm managing 9 people.) Furthermore we haven't had any major disasters that could be considered my fault. 

Today I discover a job posting advertising my exact title at my current company. It's a small company entering our slowest time of the year, business-wise and there's no room for two managers with my title. I conclude that they're going to try to replace me with someone with more experience who will work for the same non-competitive wage (20k under the industry average for the position.) 

The owner is kind of a prick and this is PRECISELY the kind of thing I would expect him to do. He finds excuses to fire pregnant women so he doesn't have to pay their health insurance during their leave. The company's main production location has so many OHSA violations that it would be a 6-figure fine if it ever got inspected.

Anybody else find it hard to open a game after they buy it?,"I don't know if I'm weird or what, but every time I get a new game I ponder for a while before opening it (unless it's something I've been really anticipating).

Right now I'm staring at Mass Effect 2, concerned I'm going to disregard anything I need to do and just vid for a week straight.

I went and looked online for the map file to replace my corrupted one, but I couldn't find any and resigned myself to redownloading and reinstalling the game.

However, I discovered an option under game properties called ""Verify integrity of local cache."" Upon running that option, steam checked out my installed game files, reported that it had found six corrupt files, and automatically downloaded those six files. It took maybe 5 minutes, and my game was up and running once more.

Tire / rim sizing question,"A friend loaned me his uber-expensive road bike, on the condition that I tune it up and replace the tires.  It's been sitting for years and the tires currently on it are shot, the rubber is rotting and weather-checked, the tubes won't hold air.  I figured I'd get a head start on the tune-up by replacing the tires myself, but the new tires I bought don't fit.  Clearly there's something about bicycle tire sizing that I don't get.

The rims are Mavic MA-40's.  The original tires are Continentals, marked C132, 700 x 23C (23-022).  I bought a pair of Specialized all-condition tires, also size 700 x 23C (23-022).  And the new tires don't fit.  I can get them almost all the way on, but seating the last few inches of the bead is impossible- it is nearly an inch below the edge of the rim, and no matter how hard I push on it I can't lever it up over the rim.  Honestly, I'm afraid to try in case it damages the rim.

Is there another component to the tire size that I missed?  Besides the numbers marked on the rim is there also something else I need to identify with respect to the tire / rim size?",bicycling

Shameless plea for help with Integration by Partial Fractions,"So, I'm not sure how kosher it is to ask for help with homework, but I need some help. So here it goes....

Integrate: ʃ2dx/(x^2(x^2-1))

    Step A: 2/x^2(x^2-1) = A/x + B/x^2 + C/(x+1) + D/(x-1)

    Step B: 2=Ax(x^2-1) + B(x^2-1) + Cx^2(x-1) + Dx^2(x+1)

    Step C: 2 = x^3(A+C+D) + x^2(B-C+D) - Ax -B

So for the system:

    A+C+D = 0
    B-C+D = 0
    -A = 0
    B = 2

My solution process to this system:

    2-C+D=0
    C+D=2
    C=2/D

    2 - 2/D + D = 0
    D^2 + 2D - 2 =0

    D= (-2 +- 12^1/2)/2
    D= (3^1/2 - 1), -(3^1/2 - 1)

So, I think my solutions are:

    A = 0
    B = 2
    C = 1-(3^1/2)
    D = (3^1/2)-1

Before I go further, does this seem right to anyone else? Typically this textbook doesn't leave us with square root numerators this early in the homework assignment.",math

"Hey /r/science, I have a question on magnetism.","There are two assumptions that I am making about the nature of magnetism when I went through this thought process. 

**1.** Magnetic fields propagate at or less than the speed of light.

**2.** Magnetic interactions between objects are actually   interactions between the magnetic fields of the objects which transfer that effect to the object producing it.

Suppose you have two magnets, and one is an electromagnet that can be turned on and off. They are separated and linked together by some distance within the range of their magnetic fields and are oriented to repel one another. Now, suppose a large burst of energy is inputed into the electromagnet to produce an extremely short lasting magnetic field. The two magnetic fields repel one another, but when the electromagnet is turned off, its field would still exist for a very short time. Now my question is, would the other magnet continue to repel this short lasting field after the electromagnet is turned off and give the apparatus a slight burst of movement?

I am by no means an expert on magnetism, but I found it an interesting thought experiment.",science

Cheap and effective 2D CAD software for Habitat for Humanity,"I work for Habitat for Humanity as an Americorps down in Louisiana.  We have an architecture firm that does our blueprints and they're fairly decent.  The problem is, they charge $125/hr for any work, and we can't justify that cost just to create a bunch of as-builts.  Right now, the way we keep track of changes is to print off an extra copy of the official prints and change dimensions with a pen.

I have familiarity with various CAD programs including AutoCAD, and we're looking for something cheap and effective to deploy on a computer in the office, or my own laptop.  I'm already on payroll and would be doing much of it in my spare time, so the cost of my time to learn a new system is negligible.  AutoCAD would be fantastic if it didn't cost so damn much.  Really all we need is something on which we can draw in 2d and make measurements in American units (feet and inches.)

Can anyone recommend an effective, worthwhile system that can do decent 2D work?  It doesn't even have to be able to read the AutoCAD files from our architect, I can manually recreate them.  Anything between free and $80 would be nice.

Google's Sketch-Up is about the quality and level of control we need, except that is a 3D program.  Not flashy or powerful but simple, quick, and effective.  I've tried QCAD but it doesn't look like they've updated anything in a year an half, except their book.  TurboCAD has a cheap option, but I don't want to shell out cash without trying it.  DoubleCAD I'm using as a demo now, but its almost impossible to get online help about it, and I don't know what features I'll lose when the 30 day trial expires and I have to use their free version.

Trouble making gains in bouldering.,"I have been climbing on and off for the last 3 years and at least twice a week for the past 7 months. I started top roping and worked my way up to about 5.10-5.11 (working a few 12's). My partners and I switched from our top rope gym to a bouldering gym.

The bouldering gym completely knocked me down a step or two.

I can finish all the beginner's routes except on the steepest walls (completely inverted transitioning to 45-vertical). I am working on those and just need to piece them together.

My question is, how do I go from these *easy* routes to the harder sloper routes. Crimpers I can do alright but it seems like bouldering focuses more on slopers. I can't even start to hold onto some of these holds. I admit that I need to loose some weight I am up to about 210-215 but what else can I do.

Any suggestion on exercises, stretches would be great. I know that form and balance play an important part in a lot of these routes, how do you learn what works? (Just watching others?)

Is there a technique for holding holds on 45 degree and higher overhangs? I am starting to get very bad callouses that rip off while I am climbing. I never had that happen with crimpy top rope routes. Is this part of joy of climbing or am I doing something wrong?",RockClimbing
A desperate plea for wise council (Garage Band crash),"Greetings, lovelies- 

I will spare you the myriad reasons why the song I lost is important...suffice it to say that far more weeks than I care to consider are at risk of being wasted and far more is at stake that I think I am even capable of considering without growing a bit faint if I cannot get back what I have lost.

Short story: I was working on my laptop off of my external drive. The USB cord connecting the two was kicked loose. Garage Band quits unexpectedly. Upon reopening, my song is back to its infantile form...a stage it was at months ago. Disaster. Tears.

Short explanation of actions already taken: I downloaded Data Rescue 3 and ran a deep search on both drives. I recovered a trillion unlabeled aif's, AIFF's and the like, though none that I have opened are from my song so far (300 down, 999,999,999,700 to go) and my beloved .band file is nowhere to be found.

Is all hope lost? I know all too well the importance of backing up files, making it endlessly more painful that this happened right as the apex of my harddrive space crisis was upon me. I tend to drag the session onto the desktop of my laptop whenever I am working on it, that being the reason I Deep Scanned my laptop's harddrive as well...but I'm working with something like 25KB free these days.

"Who else here was ""spiritual, but not religious"" before accepting atheism, rather than coming from wither a religious or secular background?","*either, not wither

Prior to atheism, I believed in a god that was simply a benign creator who loved us, yet had no dogma or bias about our lives. It simply observed and furthermore, rather than being separate from us, it literally was us experiencing all that we experience through us and as us. Therefore, any cruelty or kindness was done by itself, to and as itself, under the self-imposed illusion of not knowing it's true nature.

That sustained me for a long time, as most arguments from atheists against god focus on the Christian/Judaic/Muslim versions of god, and the kind of god I believed in was protected from 99% of those arguments because there was nothing dogmatic or anti-scientific about it to argue against.

Along with this, however, I bought into a lot of new age woo woo stuff like various kinds of divination, psuedoscience, reincarnation, astrology, dowsing, crop circles, homeopathy, and a vast laundry list of unfounded claptrap.

Once I started taking an interest in science, and found most of those ""accessory"" beliefs debunked, I had to take it one step further and apply the same rigorous protocol to my belief in ""Spirit"", as I called my version of god.

I came to the conclusion that, in the end, since this being I believed in was not judgmental and there was no heaven or hell to go to, then it didn't really matter if I believed or not. After all, if I was wrong, this being wouldn't have minded anyway. I didn't have to deal with the fear of pissing it off or being punished. 

So, I had to take the most honest stance I could: there is no evidence for this being, therefore, nothing to support a belief in it. I now lack a belief in this being, which makes me an atheist. If I do end up surviving my death, perhaps I will recognize it as this being experiencing through me what it's like to lack such a belief, then fine. But, since there is no evidence, the only honest stance is ""I don't know, but I certainly don't see any evidence to support it.""

Did anyone else go through a similar journey to atheism, rather than the usual ""I broke away from religion"" or ""I was always of this mindset""?

tl;dr - Came to atheism through a different route than many people, curious who else was in a similar boat.",atheism

"Mass Effect 2 on 360 won't import my ME1 character, even though I beat it.  Anybody else with this problem?

"I have attended a Burning Man-style event (Burning Flipside, specifically) AMA!","So I figure there are probably a good number of burners on reddit, but there's probably a lot more non-burners.

For those of you that don't know what a burn is, here]( is a link to the article on the actual Burning Man event, and [here is info on Burning Flipside, specifically.

For those of you that have mice that are allergic to links, I would sum up a burn as a temporary community in the middle nowhere, based on free expression. We build an entire society, with an effigy at the center of it. And everyone basically does their own thing, often involving themselves in theme camps. (One of my favorites is ""The Purple Taco"" camp that always serves tacos at noon.) On the last night, we burn the effigy. Then, on the last day, we completely erase our society from existence and go on our way. The motto is ""leave no trace.""

Burns are a lifechanging experience, beyond a doubt. So if anyone is curious, or has been thinking about going to one themselves, feel free to AMA!

"Expansion of a gas down an infinitely long tube, while continuous energy is added at one end. Help?","Imagine an infinitely long tube that starts out at vacuum pressure. Now imagine at one end of the tube, a set amount of energy is continuously added (in the form of molecules, some number of Joules/second). The gas would expand away from the start and down the tube. 

The pressure would always be highest near the injection point. As time passes the pressure down the tube would increase because energy is constantly being added to the system, but it would always be higher at the injection point.

I'm looking for an equation that would show the average velocity down the tube for a set of molecules at a time 't', at a distance down the tube 'x'. It'd start at 0 speed, but because of the high pressure near the injection point and the low pressure at the other end of the tube, would accelerate continuously. Feel free to pick any arbitrary tube diameter or energy injection rate. Also assume the tube is a closed system and doesn't leak heat or anything.

From thinking about it, I think there'd be some energy injection rate and tube diameter relationship (and possibly also time from t=0) where the gas wouldn't be able to expand fast enough to compensate, so the pressure would just continue to build and build at the injection point. Gas injected later would encounter more resistance to expand because there would be gas already present, so the pressure gradient wouldn't be as steep.

"What attracts the more active, street-preacher Christian is not so much objective understanding of truth and wisdom in the Bible, but rather an identification of the subject with the authority of Jesus","...I say this because there is a striking similarity in the observation of a street-preacher and Jesus.  The active preacher has very similar features to Jesus; they assume some connection with a higher truth or knowledge as expressed by their ""messianic-complex,"" and they feel called to alert people to their ""naivety.""  This is also almost identical to people outside the realm of religion.  Another example would be conspiracy theorists, the recent ""birthers,"" or the typical, pretentious college freshman philosophy major.  I remember my freshman english professor saying the same thing about his students' papers.  They would all start their papers as if they were the first ones who set their eyes upon the monumental amount if information comprising history, like the world was according to them.

"Poll: Predictions aside, who actually has a technologically illiterate older relative who wants to buy an ipad? What's their reaction when you tell them about it?","Internet consensus phase 1: the ipad is an oversized, underpowered iphone

Internet consensus phase 2: Sure, *you* don't want one, and neither do I. but apple isn't thinking about you. This is for your mom who can't use a regular computer.

The problem with theory 2 is that its been made by people who, by and large, do not actually plan to buy an ipad themselves, making their opinion a matter of punditry. Until the grandmas of the world raise their voices, we really don't have a way of knowing if its a reasonable prediction.

So let's do a poll: what do your own elder relatives say about it? Are they interested?

In the case of my own parents, they are both tech illiterate and would rather not be bothered with big, complex computer decisions. But for them, the path of least resistance is not to buy an ipad. For them, the simplest solution is just go to a store and buy a full sized computer for the same price with windows on it, and make do with what they've always known. The very people in my life least happy about complicated computers are the very people least likely to buy an apple gadget, regardless of how good it is.

"Why is it always Kirk vs. Picard for top Captain? Janeway, Archer, and Sisko had excellent qualities as well.","I've been watching a lot of DS9, Enterprise, and  Voyager recently and think that in some ways their Captains are superior to Kirk and Picard. Keep in mind that Picard will probably always be my favourite Captain. However Janeway was able to hold together a crew of half Maquis, half Starfleet through some really rough times and across many years with the odds stacked greatly against them. Sisko had to juggle being the Emissary to the worm hole aliens, but also as Captain of DS9 and the Defiant and a leader in the Dominion War. That fella had a tough job. Same goes for Archer. He was the first out in space dealing with new alien species (Earth? Never heard of it). He also didn't have the Prime Directive or any other set rules to follow. Archer had to fly by the seat of his pants and hope that everything turned out ok. He also had to deal with the Xindi terrorists in the only way he knew how. 

Why does the battle for best Captain always come down to Kirk or Picard? There were excellent Captains of other ships dealing with worse problems. Does anyone think that Kirk or Picard would be able to lose half their crew, being lost 80+ years away from home and kill the Borg on the way?

A question about boric acid and dissociation,"I'm currently taking the first level of college chemistry, and while attempting to finish a lab report, I became ridiculously confused.

The post laboratory questions include the statement that both H3PO4 and H3BO4 are polyprotic acids, and refer you to the textbook for information on how to write out the disassociation steps for each of them. The phosphoric acid (H3PO4) brought up no issues for me. However, I had read online that boric acid (H3PO4) did not dissociate in water. I looked up ""boric acid"" in the index of my textbook, and turned to a section on boron compounds. H3BO3 was mentioned, and refered to it as boric acid. The text explicitly stated that boric acid was not a polyprotic acid, but a monoprotic acid - instead of losing a hydrogen ion to create H30, H3BO3 accepted an OH ion from the water to create B(OH)4.

I wasn't too worried at that point; though both H3BO3 and H3BO4 were referred to as boric acid, the formulas were different, so it seemed entirely possible that H3BO4 could dissociate in water though H3BO3 could not. But when I looked online, I couldn't find very much information on the difference between the two. I found H3BO3 being called orthoboric acid, but occasionally the formula for orthoboric acid was given as H3BO4. Though I couldn't find much mention of H3BO4, it was most often called perboric acid, which I couldn't find any useful information on. 

The easy thing to do would be to use the same dissociation steps for H3BO4 as I had for H3PO4 with every P replaced with a B, but since I know one form of boric acid is unique in that its formula resembles that of a polyprotic acid but actually is a monoprotic acid, I'm not sure if something strange would also be going on with H3PO4.

Whatever happened to Junkyard Wars?,"So today, Adam Savage came to my university to speak.  After listening to him talk about Mythbusters and watch his compilation video of the best explosions from the show (set to the ending of the 1812 Overture, of course), I realized that the popular show Mythbusters may help popularize science and help make people curious, it still relies too heavily on large explosions and flashy ""experiments"" that SHOULD NOT BE TRIED AT HOME.

Now I bring the question to the old show, Junkyard Wars / Scrapheap Challenge.  What happened to it?  What happened to shows that were about making things, engineering and human ingenuity?  What's with all these flashy explosions?

Before someone answers my rhetorical question, I just wanted to say that I know the answer.  The show got canceled in the US after the 7th season (Junkyard Megawars 2) because the production costs were too high.  I was 16 at the time.

There was something special about that show.  Something that I believe popular shows like Mythbusters completely neglect.  The ability to make things, instead of destructively testing them.  The kind of frantic creativity that was characteristic of this country from the Cold War.  Not saying we need a political/military stalemate to get our science on, but seriously, just look at the situation in colleges today.  America isn't producing nearly enough engineers.

Junkyard Wars helped inspire a few of the engineers I find myself working with today.  However, the majority of the engineers I find in my classes have not even heard of the show.  They are boring, uninspired and do not realize that engineering can be a fun, productive endeavor.  They do not appreciate the beauty of making things with your own hands.  They like their books and their equations.

Sure, I like my academic life too, but inside my heart I still harbor this one little dream.  The same dream I had when I was 14 - that a show like Junkyard Wars might come to being, and I'll finally be old enough to apply.",science

It was estimated (by my professor) the whole ordeal would take about eight months and they offered me next to nothing. I would make over twice as much continuing to work at my minimum-wage job.

I countered for twice as much, assuming they wouldn’t be able to afford it and was okay with that. I didn’t feel like it would be a pleasant experience considering their offer. But they came back and said they could afford about that much, so I accepted and took time off my previous job to do it. I’m sorely regretting it now.

Considering I have no experience with the business aspect and freelance is hard and terrifying for even seasoned web developers, I expected I’d be getting some direction and heavy guidance from my professor. Not so. He offers very little until I do something the wrong way. If I contact him with questions, I usually get patronizing and semi-rude responses. It’s also worth noting he was the previous (and volunteer) developer for the organization and seems to be pretty close to the client.

I’m feeling extremely discouraged and turned off to the whole project. My friends/family know how I’m feeling about the whole thing but I’m getting very little support. They seem to think I should just suck it up and do it for the experience, no matter how dismal it seems to be.

Are they right? Will I screw myself out of further opportunities if this one doesn’t work out? If not, is it even worth it for me to try to “save” the project? At this point, I haven’t turned in a project plan yet and I doubt there will be any contract signing.",web_design
What's the best way to initiate a FWB relationship with a friend?,"For whoever has had experience with a FWB, how did it begin?

For me, I have a friend that I see from time to time. We've known each other for many years, but never very closely. She's mentioned that she is attracted to me, and I sometimes get the impression that she might want to be a FWB.

Obviously since I'm asking the question, I'd be interested too, but I have no idea how to approach it without coming off as a huge asshole to all our friends if I'm reading her wrong. On the other hand, I work 35 hours a week and go to school full-time, and she travels quite a bit, so an actual relationship wouldn't really work for either of us.

Any advice with what should I do? Any way to go for this or should I let it pass to make sure nothing gets screwed up?",AskReddit

My dad got two 22. rifles on his 10th birthday.  He game them to me on my 10th birthday. These are my guns.  (plus an old Sears brand 12 gauge) [PICS],"All of them

Springfield Model 15, bolt action

Winchester Model 06, 10-round pump

J.C. Higgins Model 20-12 GA

I know the rifles are really old, but I dont know how old or how much they're worth (not that I would ever sell them).  Any insight you guys have would be awesome.

Wikipedia says the JC Higgins was the Sears brand name and they stopped making them in 1961 and WikiAnswers says its worth about $100.

And sorry about the crap digital camera I'm stuck with.

edit: Also, my dad was born in 1946, just to give you an idea of their age.

edit 2:  Just found this page and found out the second one down is the **Standard Model 1906, Blued Frame Version of the 1906 Winchester**, manufactured around 1924.  

edit 3:  The Springfield 15 was manfactured in the 1930s and sold for $3.19 new - this guy said he found one for $180 wikianswers.  A few other sites have priced them at around $100.  

So it looks like these guns aren't rare or valuable by any stretch of the imagination.  But, they were my first guns and the fact they were my grandfathers makes them priceless to me.  Hope I can pass them on to a son one day.",guns

Mind Boggling…..
Now, take a look at this……101%
From a strictly mathematical viewpoint:
What equals 100%
What does it mean to give MORE that 100%?
Ever wonder about those people who say they are giving more than 100%?
We have all been in situations where someone wants you to GIVE OVER 100%……
How about ACHIEVING 101%?
Here’s a little mathematical formula that might help answer these
questions:
If:
     
      A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
Is represented as:
   1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 2122 23 24 25 26

                 H-A-R-D-W-O-R-K
       8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11 = 98%
 
And
             K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E
     11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+5 = 96%
 
But
                A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E
         1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5 = 100%
 
Then,look how far the Love of God will take you:
 
              L-O-V-E-O-F-G-O-D
     12+ 15+22+5+15+6+7+15+4 = 101%

"I've been down again recently, and I just found myself having some pretty terrible thoughts","Hey, guys and gals. It's me again.

I'm sure that you're all familiar with my story, or at least my type. I have this tendency to get depressed around the winter months (though my blue feelings seem to know no seasonal boundaries), and for the most part, I've held it off this year.

Recently, though, I've noticed some terrible changes in my character. I feel lethargic all the time, and it makes me feel as though my life is pointless. I'm in this weird paradox where I want to be alive, but I don't want to suffer through the boring spots. I've also been trying to shed this whole thing where I put being in a relationship on a pedestal. It worked for a long time, but at least once every few days it comes back to haunt me.

All of these things have made me incredibly nasty towards at least one of my friends, and I find that coming out and talking to my friends is as effective as talking to a brick wall. I have a feeling that it's because I've got this one track mind, and it's so difficult for me to break it.

I've read a lot of different stories from this particular sub-Reddit where people are trying to get over relationships, and part of the responses is ""it just takes some time."" I think that I'm just realizing how long it really will take for me. I wasn't just in a relationship with my ex-girlfriend, I had a crush on her for three years, and I still think about her (though it's getting to be less frequent as days go on).

I can't find a job, but at the same time I acknowledge that I certainly haven't put forth the necessary effort. I know that there are people who turn in applications every day, and I only fill out a handful of applications periodically only to be disappointed when no one calls. My dad convinced me that I had a slam-dunk over at a gas station, because the manager offered *him* a job; but when he went to check, the manager told him that they weren't hiring because they're short on hours as it is. Need less to say, I was incredibly disappointed.

It hasn't been all bad being single and unemployed, though. I went back to school, and made the Dean's List last semester. I suppose it's just difficult for me to put the good things on a similar level as the bad things.

The reason that I'm writing tonight is that I had fantasies about cutting myself not 45 minutes ago. It's the first time I've had such morbid thoughts in a very long time, and it convinced me that I needed to write something that someone would read and give me a decent response, and not just ""Oo.""

DAE take solace in the 'belief' that Christianity will eventually become as rare as paganism.,"I believe we are relatively close to the end of Christianity and that atheism will be the next 'age'.  If Christianity began 2000 years ago, I believe (albiet by no scientific judgment) that Christianity would fit nicely in a bell curve.  Maybe it would be a lopsided bell, but a bell it would be.

Slowly starting, gaining virtually no momentum at first, being simply written off as a silly cult in modern day culture (scientology, whoa). But then for various reasons (Tom Cruise, some disciple) it started to gain popularity and fast (steep curve). 

This popularity continued to rise till its peak, lets say the spanish inquisition (I dunno). And ever since then has been on a steady downcline (is that a word?).  

I believe now we are at the end tip of the bell.  Think about a bell, it starts with a shape incline that quickly levels out.  Then it slowly increase before it sharply shoots up (in popularity).  The same is true with the other side of the bell.  I believe that we are on the leveling out of the other side of the bell.  The bell reached it's peak and took a steady decline, but now we are at the slight decline part.

Christianity is slowly declining and eventually it will take a steep decline into myth.  Students in the future will read the bible as we now read books such as Odysseus (not that Odysseus was an overtly religious book, just that it was an epic book that was telling of its time and thinking). 

And to be honest, I consider myself an overt cynic, but that is just how certain I am of this.  Albeit, I might not be young enough to enjoy it myself (or alive at all), but hopefully I will have a great grandson (or daughter) that I can tell stories to, to make him feel grateful that he can go out and fuck freely any willing girl, guy or shemale (is that an offensive term, I really have no idea and apologize if it is) out there. And he will know, no matter what he does, his family will love him.

I can't figure out where this relationship goes from here.,"She and I have been together for 3 years.  It started slowly - exclusivity was ""fallen into"" after 4 months of dating, the L word was said at about 9 months into it, and we now have lived together for 9 months total.

We have plenty of good things: we enjoy doing many of the same things, we love each other, we very rarely fight, and we tolerate each others' quirks and give each other the appropriate amount of space.

However, I'm just not ecstatically happy in this relationship.  I feel like I could do better in the personality department.  She's not very sexy or flirtatious, and tends to get very anxious or be very competitive/aggressive.  She doesn't act very feminine.  The sex is ok, but not great - I get hella turned on by passionate noises, and she is too embarrassed to make any.  We don't have many long or deep conversations.  

I don't know, after 3 years, whether she's the girl for me.  But I don't know how to break it off, since I've never told her any of the things I don't like.  Yeah, I guess I have my own issues.  I mean, I ask her to make noise when we're having sex, and I ask her to flirt more, but she never does.

A simple line following robot for a robotics course. [video],"

This is a simple line following robot for a robotics course I'm taking. It's a simple algorithm. If it's on the line, turn right (away from the line), else turn left (back onto the line) and it seems to work pretty well.

The most annoying part of construction was actually finding the right thing to use for the third wheel (to stabilize the base of a differential drive robot). We considered some round surfaces to drag along the ground and some claw type things which generated an insanely annoying noise and made the robot look like a headcrab \(video, but those all didn't work because they generated too much friction on the tape line.

I used to be a neo-Nazi - AMA.,"Back in high school between the ages of about 16-19 I got sucked into the white supremacist ideology. It was a relatively short phase of my life, but if anyone has any questions feel free to ask.

To start off with:

No, I never hurt anybody, I was not a member of any racist group (unless you count my friends). My ""activism"" was limited to anonymously leaving copies of racist rock music albums around school bathrooms. I never supported violence, only the idea that racially segregated countries were inherently better and more peaceful. I got started in it when a friend gave me a copy of a Skrewdriver and started listening to it ironically, but eventually it started to make sense.

Edit: I also openly and honestly believed that the Holocaust was greatly exaggerated.

Another thing I forgot to mention was that I drank heavily during that period. I was taking care of my dying grandfather who'd had a stroke, and wiping someone's ass and feeding them their food can make you pretty sad, so you could definitely have called me a teenage alcoholic. I drank probably 3-4 nights a week during that time (heavily - about a half gallon of vodka a week), and when you drink that much you develop a lot of undirected anger inside. I stopped drinking altogether for about 8 or 9 months and it was during that time that I came to my senses. 

Also, I realize this may not be the most interesting AMA because I was only in it for a short time and never really did anything about it - this AMA was mainly supposed to be for anyone who had questions about the mindset.

I love &amp; hate midnight showings of cult films.,"Last night I went to a midnight showing of The Big Lebowski. I missed it the first time it was in theaters, so I wanted to go to the screening. I took my girlfriend who had never seen the film, and got her all prepped for, what was going to be, a great time.

We got seated and saw people dressed up as Walter, Jesus, and even a Nihilist...but then these drunk fucks sat behind us and got really obnoxious. They kept throwing popcorn at people, and became louder and louder. As soon as the movie started, I heard the crack of beer cans opening and giggling from the people. Then came the reciting of dialog...almost every line from the opening scene this one stupid fuck kept belting out. People around him started to yell at him and tell him to shut the fuck up...but he wouldn't listen. The whole movie he was like this...pissed me off.

At the end of the movie, they were the first ones to get up and run out of the auditorium. I overheard some people talking about them and looking to ""kick their ass"", but they were long gone. 

I understand the fandom that comes with seeing these kind of films in theaters with a die hard crowd. I just hate the fucks that act like children and ruin it for the rest of us.

Have you ever been a complete social outcast? Did you wish to be accepted by your peers? Can you give some decent advice?,"This is a problem that I've faced since middle school. Since the age of 12 or so, I've noticed that people treat me much differently than my peers. I'm 20 years old, male, a virgin, and I don't have any real friends. I am of average height, overweight by 50 lbs, and have an unattractive face. 

I spend my weekends and free time on the internet, not by choice, but instead for lack of anything better to do. I've always wanted to hang out with people, but I never get invited anywhere. I've tried hosting parties at my place, but people never show up. In most activities or clubs I've showed up at, I always come in alone, and find that most people have formed friendship groups (with me excluded). I've tried to be outgoing, friendly, and open to other people, but nobody seems to accept a casual invitation.

I've tried being kind. When I do, people end up taking advantage of me, using me for favors, or walking all over me. I've tried entertaining people, to be the life of the party. This usually ends in people encouraging me to make a fool of myself, and I used to fall for the bait. 

I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I'm sitting here almost in tears, wondering why I can't fit in anywhere. Why I've never had a real friend, why women aren't attracted to me, why I've failed miserably at basic social interactions.

Whenever I try and chat up a girl, I get this **strong** vibe that she doesn't want me there. It's not irrational, it's not anxiety. Many will simply stop talking to me, or be unresponsive. I'm not overly pushy, but never get the chance to talk about anything other than simple greetings. It feels like talking to a wall, or like batting against an empty machine. You can swing for the fences, but what's the use if you're never given anything to hit?

So where do I go from here? It is so frustrating to be ignored when talking in a group. It is heartbreaking to have a table of people go from friendly chatting to dead silence when I sit down. I'm not creepy, I'm not confrontational, and I understand basic etiquette. Do I become a complete jackass? A miser? A hermit?

I wish for nothing more than to be accepted by my peers, to feel as if I'm a part of a group, or of something. Yet, this seems far out of reach.

I lived in mass denial of this for years, and have felt depressed about it for the last couple of months. Please reddit, if you have any advice or help, I'll take it at face value.",AskReddit
DAE wish universities would hire qualified teachers to lecture?,"...rather than just getting their pet academics to do it? 

With a few shining exceptions, I've found the quality of the teaching at my uni to be beyond abysmal. Most just read the prepared slides that the textbook publishers provide, and most of the rest just have no clue about imparting information. 

And, having been privy to the teaching committee mailing lists, I can confirm that the vast majority of academics have unbounded contempt for both lecturing and coursework students, which they see as an utterly degrading distraction from their precious research, like a five-star chef being forced to clean the toilets. 

It strikes me that there's an obvious solution that would make everyone happy. Lock the academics away with their researchers and PhDs, and let them get on with it without having to stain their lily-white hands. And hire a bunch of actual fucking *teachers* to present lectures. People with communication skills, legible handwriting, an understanding of pedagogical technique and the ability to explain things. Someone with dual degrees in the topic at hand and teaching would strike me as the perfect combination. 

It wouldn't be that much more expensive, and the same institution could then have world-class research *and* world-class teaching. Which would rake the students in hand over fist, more than offsetting the cost.

Landlord/Condo Ass. Screw over?  Help?,"I just recently got a new apartment, I love the place.  I was told I could have a dog (I have the emails to prove this), and it is explicitly stated so in my lease.

Today, there's a note on my door from the condo association, telling me that it is urgent and I need to call the management company.  So I do.

They inform me that I am not allowed to have a dog, that only owners can have any animals at all and that renters cannot.  Now I tell them that my lease says otherwise.  

They tell me, pretty rudely, that my landlord then must be an idiot, because he ""well knows"" that this is not the case.  They pretty much just say ""tough cookies, get rid of the dog.""

New house came with new cat (possibly pregnant),"Note: i created a reddit account just so i could post this and share with the reddit community. I visit reddit everyday.

I just bought a new house and was moving things in from my car and on one of the last trips to the car a cat came running down the stairs and out of the house. The cat wasn't in there before and most likely slipped in when the door was open when i putting stuff in the house. I didn't think to much about it and left to get more of my stuff. When I got back i started putting boxes in the house and on the 2nd or 3rd trip from the car I went upstairs to my bedroom and found the cat rolling around on my bedroom floor. It was interesting to see the cat there having a good time. She was really friendly and was constantly kneading and purring. I Finished moving my stuff in for the night and she was still in the house. I opened the door to let her out but she wouldn't go out so i just closed the door and started setting up my computer room while she just followed me and hung around. I went to sleep and woke up with her at the end of my bed. I let her out in the morning on my way to work and when i got home she was waiting for me. Its now been about 3 or 4 days since i moved in and she is still here (currently sleeping on the couch). She looks like she might be pregnant, she has a really big belly but I can't tell. Im planning on taking her to a Vet pretty soon. 
   I attached two photo's of her of when I had found her in the house the second time around, the pictures are kinda blurry though cause she wouldn't stop rolling on the floor and I was using my camera phone. 
   another tid bit of info about the house, the previous owners apparently just got up and left one day and the house went into foreclosure. I bought the house the day it was listed for sale(closed a month later). I think the cat may have belonged to the previous owners of the house but who knows.

"Imagine... Black &amp; White, the gesture-based god game, ported to the iPad.","The whole ""hand of God"" control scheme would no longer be a metaphor. You would be tickling/slapping your creature, performing miracle gestures and dragging yourself across the land with your actual hand, not just by proxy of a mouse or trackpad. To zoom in/out, use the OS-standard pinch-to-zoom. To change your viewing angle of the world, you could turn the iPad around in your hands, or tilt it, and the built-in accelerometer will interpret and change the display accordingly. 

Make it happen and make a fortune, Lionhead Studios.

**EDIT** (copied from a reply I posted below):  
The reason I mentioned an iPad-specific port is that its features and hardware are standard in *every* iPad, and there is a marketplace already setup specifically for its users: the iTunes App Store. Yes, there are other tablets that have capacitive screens, multi-touch gestures, and accelerometers, but how many have all three? And what percentage of the tablet market do those specific products hold? And even if its user base was significant enough, how does EA Games market - and sell - a game specifically for them?

Like it or not, the iPad has garnered a lot of attention (more than any other tablet), and the iPhone has proven how successful the app store distribution model can be. I think the iPad is a logical platform choice, and a Black &amp; White port could be quite successful.

Also, purely speculation, but I imagine that given the original Black &amp; White was released for Mac, the port to iPad would be fairly easy to do compared to other PC-only games.",gaming

I've gone to Burning Man every year since 2004.  AMA,"Burning Man is many things but the simplest definition is that it's an ongoing experiment in temporary community with approximately 50,000 participants every year (49,599 in 2008  *Update: 51,459 in 2010!*). In the six years I've been I have gone by myself and with large groups. I've camped in RV's, domes and pup tents.I've also had some of the most intense, insightful, dusty, thought provoking, fun, terrible and amazing personal growth experiences of my life.  

Burning Man takes place in a dry lake bed in northwest nevada in late august in a city that only exists for one week. It is known for its amazing art and temporary suspension of social norms which allows participants to explore any aspect of themselves they wish in a safe and supporting environment. The event will have been going on for 23 years this year and as such it has a fabulously storied and well rounded history and mythology. The event has grown and changed over the years and continues to do so.

If you've heard about it, you may have heard that it is a crazy hippy nude fest in the desert where there are no rules and everyone is eating granola and singing kumbaya around a campfire. While I won't pretend that doesn't happen (certainly not in my camp!) I will state that Burning Man is *far more* then that. It's way more geek then it is hippy, in fact it is one of the most techy places on earth. Hell, from what I understand Google used to RECRUIT there...I can believe it.  It's also a place of civic pride!  I've volunteered to help make the city tick for the past few years being both a Greeter, a lamp lighter, and this year I'm going to try Rangering. (*Update: Rangering was fucking AWESOME, I think I found a new calling*)

Burning Man is highly organized. It has streets, addresses, sporadic power grids, radio stations, a zip code. Hell, it has an airport and you can send AND receive mail there!  It is the 3rd largest city in Nevada during the week it happens and trust me, it is a city. Here is a photo of the event taken from an airplane - as you can see it is very well organized and laid out with streets, blocks, and neighborhoods: 

Anyway, I thought this might be an interesting AMA, so go for it.

How can anyone be for the death penalty when trials (based on a jury) are never going to be fair and bring real justice?,"I watch lots of crime dramas and read lots of the news, so maybe my understanding is skewed, but as far as I know: A jury is selected, these are people from the public called forward to do jury duty. A lot of these people don't want to be there, they want to go back to doing their jobs or looking after their family, so that would bring me to the conclusion they don't necessarily care that much (of course some people take it seriously, but it only takes 1 not to...).

So how can this be fair? How can a jury of ""normal"" people who don't necessarily have any interested in being there and people who could be easily swayed by charisma be given the responsibility of deciding if someone is guilty?

Let's not forget how lawyers are different, a poor person could get a really shit lawyer who knows very little of what they do and represent the person poorly, or a rich person could get the best lawyer around. If both were charged with the same crime and the evidence was flaky, you can be pretty sure the rich guy will get off and the poor guy will be convicted, because representation matters a great deal. 

How can people who agree with the Death Penalty think this is right? I would never really agree that the death penalty is *good* or *right*, but I could understand it **if** it was possible to be 100% sure of someone's guilt.

tl;dr: How can anyone agree with the death penalty when the people relied on to form a decision aren't necessarily in the position to do so properly? How can anyone agree with the death penalty when the representation of the accused matters a huge deal?

"Hannibal Lecter, liver, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors","""In the 1991 film The Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal Lecter mentions that he once ate the liver of a census taker ""with some fava beans and a nice Chianti."" This is Lecter's most famous quote. As a psychiatrist, he would know that he had named three of the ""forbidden foods"" for patients taking MAO inhibitors.""



I'm a little bit stuck on this quote from wikipedia... I'm trying to figure out if there's a plot point here (to Silence of the Lambs), insider joke, or symbolism regarding the forbidden foods (for people who are taking maoi's... or just people who don't eat other people)",reddit.com
Foodit - I watched Food Inc. (finally) for the first time tonight.  Let's have a chat.,"For awhile now, I've been more conscious about what's going into my body.  It has less to do with political outrage and more to do with the fact that I'm getting older; I need to do whatever I can to keep myself healthy and intact.  I barely eat fast food - I have someone pick me up a cheeseburger once or twice a month if I'm hungry, but I stopped drinking soda and I try not to eat out often, if at all.  I'm not perfect, but I suspect that if we're honest, neither are any of us.

So the question isn't so much what can I do to change my dietary intake on a grand level; I can shop at our local co-op and farmer's market, I can buy more organic products, I can avoid HFCS (which I've made great strides to do), etc.  The question is, how do I make these changes translate into my personal life?  I'm not a terribly good cook, but I'm trying to improve; my kitchen is not well stocked, but I'm fixing that.  I have cookbooks scattered about, but none of this is translating very well into the changes I want to see.

How does one begin the transition to, if you will, getting off the grid?  Is there a foundation of simple recipes, is there a good web resource or two?  Does anyone have a good seasonal buying guide?  I don't even know what I need to know.  What I'm asking, maybe suggesting, is that we start a resource to help more of your average Joe Sixpack (which I am) to start getting further from the Food Machine.  I want less high-minded idealism and more kitchen-based realism.  The floor is yours.",food
Help me come out of this situation!!,"Hi Reddit,

(My sentence framing wont be impressive as I am not that much good at English language.)

Pleas help me come out of this situation.3 years back I was working in a software company as a developer.There was this guy who was my colleague in the same company &amp; we both shared common interests about entrepreneurship. One day he decided to quit the company to start his own project(web based). Besides working in the same company I used to help him in his project development &amp; I was more like moral support to him. He used to praise me about my support, my creative skills, my passion towards Entrepreneurshsip &amp; we became very close. After a year I too decided to quit the company to join in his project in the marketing field &amp; he was very happy about it. He made an oral commitment that we both will share 40% of profits each &amp; 20% goes to his uncle who was an investor to his project. At that time I never concentrated much on legal things as I wanted to help him build the product.

When I joined him, the project was still under development- he was in the technical field doing coding &amp; I was in the marketing. After a month or so things started getting bad between us. He never used to like my work, my skills &amp; he used to show his frustration on me on whatever I do. He used to underrate me about not knowing technical skills &amp; I used to get hurt really bad. Even if I wanted to learn technical skills he wouldn't let me do that saying ""you cannot learn it"". Not knowing what to do I used to do all kind of crap work in his project &amp; after 10 months when the project was about to go live, we had an argument again &amp; this time he criticized me very badly about my work. So finally I decided that I need to quit working for his project &amp; that decision did not bother him at all. When I asked him about the compensation, as I had invested some money which I saved during my job days, he refused to pay it saying I did not deserve anything. This time I scolded him very badly about his integrity, morality &amp; loyalty. Finally I quit his project &amp; for the next 2 months I could not do anything as I got really depressed. I lost money, time &amp; in the eyes of the people I am an idiot. Now I have started to work out on everything, building technical skills, working on my self-esteem &amp; looking for a job. 

Now he launched his project &amp; sends me an email once every two weeks to sign up for his website. I don't want to think about him at all but when he sends me an email I get depress again &amp; will waste 2 days on it thinking about the past. What I should I do with this guy- should I teach him a lesson or should I beat him or should I defeat him in technology? Pleas help me..",AskReddit

"Hey reddit - how often does your mobile phone ring right when are looking at it, or about 10-15 seconds after you check it? I get this a lot.","I get this far too often. 60% of the time I will think I heard my phone, or wonder if I've missed a call, I will check, and about 5-6 seconds later the phone will start the 'pre-ring' where, in my case, the phone flashes up once, for about 80ms before a ring or vibrate even happens. The phone hasn't started ringing or received a call when I first check.

At other times, I will start looking at my phone, thinking about someone, and within 30 seconds I will get the call (this happens 5-7 times a week, and I never look at my phone for more than a minute and not frequently, i.e. I am not looking at my phone ~3000 times a day for ~30 seconds a time)

I figure there must be some very quiet speaker noises I pick up on for some of the more immediate calls, but then ones that happen much later, when I have a good chance to think about what I was waiting for from the other person, happen frequently enough to make me wonder about probabilities.

So, anyone else get this a lot?

I am assuming there is some... pattern. Maybe if I check, I am always expecting a message or call n minutes or hours after I make one, or I tend to get them at specific times in the day (I can't see a pattern there, and I am fairly sensitive to patterns)",reddit.com

"Is it crucial to get a decent job by a certain age, or is that a thing of the past?","Hey all, 

I've been having a bit of a problem lately working out exactly what I want from life. 

I'm 25 (26 in July), currently unemployed and have been out of University since June 2008. I held a sales job for a while but staff restructuring saw me made redundant from that. I'm job hunting right now but... 

...I'm still not precisely sure what I want from life. I love photography but it's a hard field to break into. My Uni course was (mostly) in web design and graphics but often the web design jobs want more experience than I have. 

I'm seriously debating doing some kind of charity work abroad, something involving travel or whatever - basically getting away from the grind of job hunting and seeing the world. 

However I'm worried that being 25/26 - I'm going to come back and when a potential employee asks what I've been doing since Uni, I'm not going to have the most full answer for them - a couple of months charity work isn't exactly a *lot*. 

So should I just buckle down and get on with job hunting? Is it really time I put aside fancy notions of travel - because when I come back it will have done me more harm than good? Or does nobody really care how old you are any more, and careers aren't things you have for life as they used to be?

I've also seen a local designer who has served some 60+ funeral homes throughout New England. His work is fairly mediocre, but they both seem to be making a living microtargetting their business to such a fine degree.

"Spanish ""Patatas Bravas"" - Nice spicey chunk potatoes.","Yesterday I finally pinned down my patatas bravas. I thought I could share.

Before I start, this is the sauce my mum used to make. In fact you can google around and it is nearly impossible to find a recipe for patatas bravas that doesn't involve going down to the shop and buying barbecue sauce, which is kind of lame.

Please note that the amounts below are aproximate, I cook on the fly, so feel free to experiment with these guidelines. Also this recipe involves the hot spice cayenne peppers, I very much encourage you to try and find your perfect amount.

The following are the amounts for one serving:

INGREDIENTS:

For the sauce:

* 1 garlic clove

* 1/2 cube of concentrated vegetable soup or 1 teaspoon of veggie bovril

* 3 whole dried cayenne peppers or 1 teaspoon of powdered cayenne peppers

* 1 spoon of wheat flour

* 1 teaspoon of paprika (If you can get your hands on Spanish pimentón de la Vera it's even better, and actually the original spice).

* 1 glass of water

* 100g fried tomato sauce

* 1 spoon of oil

For the mayonnaise:

* 1 egg

* 1 teaspoon of balsamic vinegar

* 100 ml Extra Virgin Olive Oil

* salt

Of course, 1 big potato.

PREPARATION:

Peel and chop the potato in chunky pieces of around 2cm. Boil the potato in salty water (not all the way through as if to make potato mash) and then deep fry it in your oil of choice.

While the potato is boiling you can prepare the sauce. In a frying pan pour about a spoonful of oil and heat. Finely chop the garlic clove and add it to the warm oil and stir until golden. If you are using whole cayenne peppers, add them with the garlic. A bit before the garlic is golden, add the half cube of concentrated soup or bovril and melt it a bit (it's not necessary to melt it all the way), shortly after, add the flour and fry it. Add the paprika or pimentón,  and the cayenne pepper if you're using powder. Mix well and add the water and the tomato sauce. Stir until it has a quite dense texture.

This is the recipe so far, mix the potatoes with this sauce after frying them.

Personally, I like to add some mayonnaise to this recipe, so this is how I make it:

In the blender cup add, in this order, the egg, a pinch of salt, the balsamic vinegar and the oil. Put the blender all the way down and slowly bring it up, mixing all the ingredients.

Important note on the mayonnaise:

* First, this is a tricky sauce, if you've never made it before, it may take some tries before you get it right. Also, blending for too long can turn the mayonnaise into butter.

* Second, this amounts have a little less oil than it usually takes to make normal mayonnaise, this makes the resulting sauce have a softer texture, more of a dense liquid than the normal texture of industrial mayo.

* Last, and most important, making mayonnaise with balsamic vinegar and olive oil gives it a VERY STRONG TASTE, it may not be of the liking of everyone. Also, that taste fits this recipe very well, but it is not very good for other common uses of mayonnaise where we would want a softer flavour.",food

Need diagnosis: love or obsession? What next?,"It all begun when I was young and stupid. Now, few years older and still stupid I ask Reddit for advice. We were both 15 at the time and going to same school. I don't know what struck me that day. In middle of spring I saw her just like any other day. Except that fact, that I felt something strange - later I called it love. My heart was going crazy, pumping blood in my veins like there was no time to waste. Thousands thoughts per second came through my mind. Her presence in same room was giving me so much power to do anything... except for one thing. I couldn't tell her. When I tried, I couldn't say a word. I can't blame it on being extremely shy - that's why I called myself stupid at the start.

As time passed each of us got involved in different relationships. We have chosen different colleges so we have lived without news from each other. None of my relationships would last longer that 12-18 months. It's all because of girl I loved few years back. Even when I tried, I couldn't forget her or stop loving. Sounds silly, but hurts a lot.

Ten years after first described event I said to myself: ""OK, let's close this chapter"". I decided to end with it as I couldn't live like that much longer. I wrote a message.

Know there's nothing I can do about it, but just want to share it and her this story from her point of view. The point is she's kind of avoiding me. Not answering emails, ignoring messages via IM.

I could ask on of her friends for her phone number of current address, but that may put me in even worse position - I don't want that.

Feb 1st - Progress reports.  Today's goal: Write out your behavior chain.,"Welcome to February.  Please share more of your experiences and progress.  Checking in here every day as a regular habit can and will help!

So I dug out a sex addiction book (it was more general than just porn addiction) that I'd bought when I quit.  One of the exercises in it is to write out a behavior chain that describes the slow incremental slide to a regression of behavior that occurs when you are trying to quit that behavior.  I'll share with you guys what I had written down.

* Woke up feeling aroused
* Thought about how good it felt looking at porn
* Felt guilty and thought I should be strong
* Saw something suggestive on TV
* Looked it up online because it wasn't porn
* Thought I wanted to see something more explicit
* Told myself it wouldn't really hurt anyone
* Thought I'd make it quick and be done
* Looked at porn and started to masturbate

By identifying this typical chain I was giving myself lots of opportunities to break the chain when I recognize it beginning.  So what you're going to do (even if it's just in a temporary text editor, but better if you write it out or print it) is write out a typical behavior chain for yourself and then think about ways between each step that you can break that chain.",pornfree

* In 2004 Pelosi objected to a CIA program that gave money to moderate Iraqi political parties in response to Iran funding Iraqi fundies. Pelosi spoke to Rice, the program was dropped.

* In 2009 it came to light that Pelosi knew about waterboarding and torture the entire time. At first she lied, but then backpedaled and admitted to knowing. When asked about what kind of objections she raised, she said she never gave any - not even so much as a classified letter to the administration denouncing the torture - saying ""No, no, no, no, no, no . . . No letter or anything else is going to stop them from doing what they're going to do.""

* We know her claims of being helpless are not true, as we now have a verified case of Pelosi, minority party leader, having influence over Bush administration GWOT programs.

* No one in the press is hounding her on the fact her party has been in vocal protest after the fact but silent the whole time it went on. Pelosi announced that she would not take more questions on the topic, and the media complied.

* In 2009 it came to light that Pelosi knew about waterboarding and torture the entire time. At first she lied, but then backpedaled and admitted to knowing. When asked about what kind of objections she raised, she said she never gave any - **not even so much as a classified letter to the administration denouncing the torture** - saying ""No, no, no, no, no, no . . . No letter or anything else is going to stop them from doing what they're going to do.""

* We know her claims of being helpless are not true, as we now have a verified case of Pelosi, **minority** party leader, having influence over Bush administration GWOT programs. 

* No one in the press is hounding her on the fact her party has been in vocal protest **after the fact** but silent the whole time it went on. Pelosi announced that she would not take more questions on the topic, and the media complied.

Need help to find a nice video game to play with my wife...,"Hi /r/gaming!

I'm trying to find out a good *video* game to play with my wife... We both really liked player Katamari Forever on the ps3.

Dear Reddit: My 5 yr old son had this idea before his brain injury in May of '08.  Help me make it happen!,"I run 2 small fruit &amp; vegetable stores in Belleville, IL (just outside of St. Louis, MO) Belleville Farmer's Market. As with most families who's lives revolve around a small family business, conversation around the dinner table is usually focused on the store.  My two sons took a great deal of pride in being able to join in the discussion and my wife and I would always hang on their every word like we were dining with Warren Buffett.  Needless to say, the boys got a big kick out of it.

My oldest son (Reece) was nearly 5 years old when he mentioned that we should let his classmates on our truck and let them sample the fruits &amp; veggies they don't get a chance to try at home.  I was blown away.  My 4 year old had just come up with an innovative, fun way to show kids that trying a bite of celery or broccoli isn't going to hurt them and they might even (shudder at the thought) like it!

That was just a couple months before we were involved in a car accident on May 31st on the way home from Diego Live! in St. Louis.  We were side impacted and Reece suffered a traumatic brain injury that he's still recovering from.  While he works harder in therapy 5 days a week than anyone should ever have to, his Mom and I still haven't heard his precious voice since that day nearly two years ago.

When Pepsi announced that they were going to be giving grants away for ideas that could benefit the community we live in, I knew instantly I had to submit Reece's idea.  Now I need Reddit's help to make Reece's idea a reality.  All you have to do is head to refresheverything.com/tastebuds and vote for us.  Reece and I thank you!!!

"""Odd health issues"" Follow up. A few questions for you guys.","Hello Ladies.

First and foremost: Thanks for your support and kind words.
Here is a follow up.

First post

Second post

So I went to the Second Opinion Doctor.

She was awesome.

She took me to her office and we discussed everything very throughly.

She told me that the hormone replacement therapy was a little agressive and perhaps more of a 'old school' solution- but not out of the ordinary. 

They can't test your hormone levels *while* you are on BC- you'll get skewed results. (Maybe this should have been obvious to me in the beginning?)

We discussed my options and we think that taking me off BC and installing?/inserting? a copper IUD is the way to go.

Sweet. 

I am offically off the pill now. How exciting. I can't wait to see what changes occur in my body (dropping weight, less mood swings, etc) for the better. 

I feel like it could really change my life having removed the synthetic hormones from my body.

Oddly enough, my S.O. and I have not decided if an IUD is the right thing for us yet. (I have a month to decide before I schedule the procedure.)

The doctor said the minimum time to leave it in (to make the money spent on it and the pain of insertion worthwhile) is roughly 2 years. 

We are still discussing when to make babies. When we feel we will be 'ready'. But I think we have both come to the conclusion that 2 years probably won't make us feel any more ready than we do now. 
How the hell do you ever feel 'ready' to have kids?

____________________

I was on BC for ten years. Have any of you ladies went off of it after such a long time? 
Did you notice any changes (bad or good)?

Also to those with children (or not)- was there ever a time that it felt like you were 'ready' for children? Or is it almost always a happy accident?

This is an exciting period of change for me! Any stories, advice?

What is the distribution of the residuals between the right tail of a gaussian and the right tail of another gaussian that has been shifted positively by a third gaussian?,"I get the feeling that r/stats doesn't like questions, but if anyone has a clue I would really appreciate hearing from you.  I'm also curious how the distribution of those residuals would be different if the ""shifting"" distribution is exponential or poisson.

I want to test the residuals for differences from zero, but I don't know if a t-test is appropriate.  Thanks for any thoughts!",statistics
"I wish there was a badge you could get that would tell any salesperson that ""I'm not a fucking idiot, please treat me like an informed human being instead of sack of meat will dispense money if annoyed enough""","My wife and I went to try and sign up at Lifetime Fitness this weekend... And while dealing with the salesperson they gave us, and the treatment we got was so bizarre that I was starting to think that maybe I was on some kind of hidden camera show.  

They send the guy down, and I have the gall to ask for a tour of the facility, information on the costs of different levels of membership, and what products and services those levels of membership provide.  Crazy, right?  How dare the customer actually have the nerve to want to know how much he's being charged, and what is being provided for what he's paying for.  Madness!  (And before it is suggested, my wife and I were both well dressed and articulate, and the cost of any membership was negligible to us.  We are not the kind of people that a salesman will look at and assume are just broke-ass looky-loos.)  

Instead, the guy basically keeps us in the lobby and is balking over a general tour ""Wow, this place is 80,000 square feet! Where would I even start!""... Uh, maybe in the exercise area? And then the pool and the fitness studios?  Seriously what the fuck?  Why do I need to tell YOU what fucking machine in particular I want to use before you'll just walk us around the damned club?

It became pretty transparent what he was trying to do... He wanted to get us all worked up over a few specific features so we'd get so excited that we'd just sign up on the spot without worrying about silly little things like price or what is included in our package.  It was really insulting to our intelligence... We had basically walked into the place already deciding to get a membership that day, but this douchetard basically talked us out of it by dealing with us like we were retarded money dispensers instead of human beings.  

So really, I would love some type of badge that says the following to a salesperson:

-I am an intelligent and informed consumer that does my own research and does not respond to rehearsed sales ploys. 

-I don't care what the cost per-month is, I want to know how much total cost I'm on the hook for. 

-I'm not a cheapskate, but if you don't put prices on your drink menu, I'm not ordering it.  

-I will not under any circumstances buy an extended warranty or a service plan on an $80 printer, or on practically anything for that matter.

-I do not make financial decisions emotionally.  Give me information on cost and features, do not attempt to get me ""excited"" about the product in the hopes that I'll forget about such practical considerations. 

-In addition to being treated as a customer, I would also like to be treated like a human being.  

Would that be so bad?  Then the salespeople will know not to approach me and waste my time with stupid rehearsed bullshit, and could instead... you know... sell me things using facts instead.",business

* Take away metal bowl

Protein: Black Soldier Fly,"This might gross a lot of you out but an easily raised food source is the maggot of the black solider fly.  If you live in an are that's in there natural range and you have a compost pile you've undoubtedly seen those huge 1 inch maggots in your compost pile.  Good chance that's a black soldier fly maggot.  
  
Black soldier flies do all their eating as maggots.  In their adult stage they dont eat which keeps them from being a nasty disease vector like the blow fly.  Since they do all their eating as maggots they need to gather all the nutrients they need to go through metamorphosis, fly around as an adult, mate and find a suitable location to lay it's eggs.  They're packed with calcium, which could be in short supply in a collapse situation.  
  
You can start your own black soldier fly compost bin where almost anything you throw in there will be devoured by these voracious little eaters.  They will eat just about anything.  Once the soldier fly maggot has gotten it's fill it crawls off someplace to spend the winter and waits for the spring to do it all again.  Yes!  You can feed them just about anything and then they preserve themselves and will probably stay alive (ie  preserved) for months and months.

"Ask r/entertainment: What's the best way to catch 
up with Lost? (no spoilers please)","I decided to finally give Lost a shot after hearing years worth of grand praise mixed with very vocal frustration. I'm about half way through the first season and I'm already starting to see why people complain. I just finished episode 12 (the one with Kate's case), and sat there thinking, ""W(hy)TF did I just watch that?""

In the episode before (trying not to be specific to not spoil anyone else here) someone disappeared, and two other characters made what appeared was going to be a significant discovery. Those two storylines were barely mentioned in the next episode. I can understand glossing over certain plot points to visit another part of the story, but a person is missing, possibly in grave danger, and suddenly it's like it never happened. The characters who were desperately searching in the last episode are now going about their daily business. Say wha?

So I figured if the wagon wheels are starting to rattle already in the first season, I'm going to run out of patience quick when I get to the episodes that people really complain about. So I hit the internets in search of an ""essential episodes"" type of list. Here's one I came up with:



There's at least one suggestion there on a few episodes to skip, and apparently it's also an option to just go straight to season four and watch the recap there.

"My friend is going to re-marry a woman who cheated on him, divorced him and exploited him for money.","Here's the situation:

He was married for 2 years, and his wife was always being unfair to him. It didn't bother him, he loved her, and he was happy. But then, there are some signs she's cheating. She disappears, and we find out she ran off with some guy. She comes back six months later in debt and asks for forgiveness, says she's changed. He pays off her debts, which takes about half his savings. She then makes him go on a ""second honeymoon,"" to the Bahamas, calling him unromantic when he cites their financial situation. Then, just as his savings have reached a low, they realize his company might lay him off. She divorces him shortly after. She ran off with some of his money, and leaves him emotionally broken. His work performance is affected, and he loses his job. He's a wreck for a year until he starts to pick things up and gets a new job (but the pay is not as good). He even starts dating again. Since he's a good looking, nice guy, he quickly meets a girl. I'm relieved because she seems like a good person. But then his ex-wife comes back (again carrying some debt), wanting to start things up again. He tells her about his new relationship, but she tells him how much she still loves him, how much it was all a mistake, how he shouldn't give up what they had. She convinces him to break up with his new girlfriend, who is crushed. At first the ex-wife doesn't want to get married, so they have been dating for 6 months. My friend now works a 12 hour job. He seems much more stressed now, but he tells me the money is worth it, since his previous job wasn't as good as the one he was laid off from. I can't be sure his ex-wife pressured him to get this job, but they got engaged pretty quickly after he was hired.

I and some other friends have told him over and over how bad and unfair this is and will be, but the thing is, this friend doesn't really think what his ex-wife did was all that unfair. He's cool and laid back. He never gets mad or retaliates when someone hurts him, just lets it happen. Sometimes he gets really broken (when she divorced him), but he still keeps the people who did it close to him. He doesn't seem to defend himself by avoiding bad people. He's never avoided bad friends, coworkers, and in this case, women.

How do I help him?

**Edit:** Thank you for your replies Reddit. You made me realize that I need to mention: This woman has a magnetic personality and is very convincing with words. Words and people are her forte, unfortunately. She also has a way of making unfair things sound justified. (i.e. tossing away a friend who's going through a really hard time turns into ""I think it's fair to give myself space from someone I'm uncomfortable with."" The more she says, the more you think it's the friend's fault, not hers.) Who knows how reasonable she sounds to him? I think this is really the thing that's making him believe her over everyone else. 

Two friends confronted her after the divorce. They found out that she rationalized and justified her actions. For example, she seemed convinced that she wasn't wrong to divorce him when his savings were low (due to her debt) and risked losing his job because ""it was a healthy financial and mental decision for her."" But she did seem really bothered when accused of being amoral and selfish.

"Searching for painting: The Optimist - Russian artist, I think.","Maybe 17 or 18 years ago, I was at an art gallery in New Jersey, which was doing an exhibit on - I believe - Russian painters.  One of the paintings depicted a city in ruins, such as after a catastrophe.  A stylized man (sort of like a wooden puppet, as I recall) in a suit sat smiling stupidly as he fished in a putrid puddle in the middle of it.

I have had no luck finding this, and I just burst out laughing hysterically in the middle of this quiet gallery - something about the sense of it really resonated with me.

All I can recall is that this was a Russian exhibit, the painting had to be from the 20th century, and the name ""Ratislav Sazonov"" comes to mind, although all searches on that name turn up nothing - my spelling may be wrong, and memory may fail.

Does anyone know what I am talking about?  I'd give anything for a print of this.  I have tried google and bing image searches to no avail thus far.",Art

RMAG February Update -- Lots of progress!,"There has been a lot going on behind the scenes, so I thought I'd recap where we're at to get everyone on the same page.


The engine team, headed by Chrisf and Svenstaro, hosted a few gloriously productive hacking sessions using Gobby.  The result was the foundation of **BaconEngine**.  Though written in C++, it communicates with a Python instance for scriptability.  Python will also be used for portions of the engine, so get in touch with your fearless leaders (IRC is a good bet) if you think you can help.  


Charlieb started working on the **skeletal animation system** that the engine will use, inspired by Aquaria.  It uses Python and Pygame.  While not yet integrated into the main code base, you can find it here. 


On the toolchain front, Svenstaro created an **Arch Linux VM** that has all Machine dependencies, as well as the code, preinstalled.  You can bittorrent it from here.


There has been push to centralize the scattered RMAG infrastructure into a **Redmine installation**, lovingly administered by RobotCaleb.  There, you'll find the wiki and forums which will subsume the Wikidot wiki and Google Group.  You can visit redditmakesagame.org to find links to our Redmine and other resources.  


I'm less familiar with the happenings on the art and design front, but there appear to be **no shortage of concept drawings, music submissions, and level ideas**.  Jean Eric and Stiev Sigma are your art leads, Faet and Trentish are on top of design.  Remember to link your submissions on the wiki so they're easy to find later!

Ten Key Principles in Economics,"Everything has a cost. There is no free lunch. There is always a trade-off.

Cost is what you give up to get something. In particular, opportunity cost is cost of the tradeoff.

One More. Rational people make decisions on the basis of the cost of one more unit (of consumption, of investment, of labor hour, etc.).

iNcentives work. People respond to incentives.

Open for trade. Trade can make all parties better off.

Markets Rock! Usually, markets are the best way to allocate scarce resources between producers and consumers.

Intervention in free markets is sometimes needed. (But watch out for the law of unintended effects!)

Concentrate on productivity. A country’s standard of living depends on how productive its economy is.

Sloshing in money leads to higher prices. Inflation is caused by excessive money supply.

!! Caution: In the short run, falling prices may lead to unemployment, and rising employment may lead to inflation.

I was wondering what others thoughts of it and what happened were though, so please share them.

I did think some of the performances and dialog were a bit forced, but it only seemed that way during the first half, so it may have been intentional, or I just got used to it.

I am solo for 22 years and counting. I want to change that.,"I need some advice.

I'm a 22 year old male that never had a girlfriend. That, of course, includes no sex but also no kissing, no holding hands, nothing. Although I make fun of it most of the time, it really is bothering me lately (as in last few years). I would even go as far as saying it's not about being a virign and having sex but I want a soulmate, a partner. I want someone to cuddle in the evening.

I can't say for sure but I think being lonely all the time severly impacts my life. It just feels like I can't go on with it (as in, I don't know, grow up, behave like a man) as long as this elemental part is missing. I'm stuck in my usual routine, do stupid things on weekends, struggle with when I sleep or get up, don't really have motivation for university etc. My morale isn't really high and I'm rather chaotic.

I always try to analyze my situation, where does this come from and I'm pretty sure I know. I was born cross-eyed (like really cross-eyed). Had a surgery when I was small with little effect. This lead to me being cross-eyed for my whole life up to the age of 20, where I had another surgery with way better results. It isn't perfect, but more on this later. Being cross-eyed made me become a stupid computer nerd. It's not like I didn't have friends or did stuff outside (I did skateboarding for example, so I might count as cool back then) but in the end, I spent my whole teenage life doing anything but hitting on girls. When I turned 18, I started going to clubs and get drunk and the usual stuff, but still, no real attempts at getting to know girls. It feels like the 20 years really have scarred me.

I've no idea wether I'm attractive or not (friends tell me I'm alright but they're friends, what else are the supposed to say). I'm not really tall (Warning: Metric unit ahead: 1.75m) and really skinny. So I'm not really manly. Being skinny seems to be a result of my stupid metabolism. I myself would be the tall strong manly man but I'm quite the opposite.

Now that my eyes are rather fixed, I thought I might change and eventually become the person I alaways wanted to be, but it just won't work. I think I have a rather low self-esteem and talking to strangers is hard for me. Eye contact seems to be the key in approaching girls, and I just can't do it. Not just with girls but all strangers basically. The standard trick for this kind of problems (I'm very shy) is getting boozed up. And in fact, about every weekend I'm drunk beyond good and evil. And still, there's not a single moment between sober and passing-out-drunk where I'd have the courage to talk to girls, I just can't do it.

Regarding the partying: I guess this is where everyone else gets to know girls, but I don't. Even when I see someone attractive my stupid brain starts working and goes like ""What to say?"", ""Is this going to be a one-night stand? You have no experience"", ""What will be the result? What if she tries to kiss you if you talk to her, you have no clue about it"" and stuff like that. Plus, I yet have to experience the feeling of girls being attracted to me. Friends sometime tell me some girl might like me but I don't believe them, I didn't register it myself.

A bit more about me: I'm anything but the boring shy-in-the-corner guy. As I said, I go out every weekend, get drunk, dance like a maniac. I am a DJ myself, which should give me some coolness points. I dress decently and I don't smell or anything like that. My outward appearance is important to me.

So to come to an end on this post: I think it's all about my insecurity and I have no idea what to do. Even being drunk doesn't help me. Any tips on how to handle this? Should I get professional help (I considered it)? How to improve my self-esteem? How to find a girlfriend?",relationship_advice
Is it just me or do other Apple fans think that the iTunes store is a horrible way to distribute applications?,"I can see the idea of a music store in a music application. This makes sense. I can see the idea of synchronizing your portable music device with a music application. But then the iPhone and iPod touch came along, and apps arrived at the iTunes store.

You have a music player now that becomes your software for interfacing all mobile devices? That's just sloppy design. It breaks the Unix-y idea of one executable, one function entirely. It also closes down Apple mobile devices to open software distribution, as we well know but rejected applications. As a huge Mac fan, this is really concerning me about Apple's future. Does this concern you guys? Linux based operating systems are getting better, and I'm only able to use Macs because of their BSD-origins &amp; MacPorts.

"Dear Reddit, Need Help! (Seattle)","Dear Reddit,

I was in charge of performances for the Japanese Student Association, Matsuri Festival. Our Matsuri festival is on February 27th, 2010 at the University of Washington from 5 PM until 9 PM.

Due to the inner workings at University of Washington (where our president gets paid nearly a million dollars), and the tuition hikes (14% this year, and 16% increase next year... 30% in 2 years) and the lack of funding for student organizations. I'm in an **extreme** pinch.

We didn't have as much money as we thought we would have for our Matsuri festival. The cost of renting the room increased, the amount of food we need increased and everything. We simply are unable to pay honorarium/performance fees.

My budget shrank considerably down to $500. I needed at least $1,500. My budget is barely enough to get two decent performers. We need a total of 8-9. I really want to present an authentic, and good performances so people can really get a sense of Japan through it, and get a new experience.

If you're talented, or know someone who is talented and can do something related to Japan for free please PM me!

-- ABOUT MATSURI --

It's a festival we hold annually. This is the 4th annual Matsuri festival. It's centered around introducing Japanese culture to the local community, university students, people interested in Japan or people who just want to have an interesting experience. We usually get around 2,000+ people comprising of kids, parents, high school kids and university students,

We present Japanese culture through performances, games, food and other forms of entertainment. Also, the entrance is free, because we want to make this accessible to anyone and everyone. However, food costs tickets ($1 = 2 tickets, and food is around 2-8 tickets).

"Car owners, please read this and pass it on. If you're ever in a vehicle and you're unable to stop the acceleration, shift into neutral - DO NOT turn the  engine off!","I can't believe how many people are suggesting in this thread that Toyota owners simply turn the engine off if their accelerator sticks! 

**This is advice that could be potentially fatal.**

 I guess I assumed that this was common knowledge, but if you kill the engine while a vehicle is in motion your power steering and power brakes will *cease functioning*! The engine provides power that allows these helpful systems to operate.  You will have a grace period with the brakes from residual pressure that was built up while the engine was powered, but your steering system will immediately become underpowered and sluggish - almost like steering through thick syrup. In addition, there's a chance that your steering column could lock and lose your ability to steer entirely. Obviously this is a less than ideal complication in what is already an emergency situation. 

Please, if you're in a vehicle and you are unable to control the throttle, immediately apply the brakes and shift into neutral. Your engine will rev out of control, but your power assisted systems will remain operational and you will not accelerate. You can then safely guide your car safely to the side of the road and brake unimpeded. Yes, you run the risk of engine damage, but it's a small price in exchange for safely controlling the situation.

What is the most unique human ability that separates us from other animals?,"What do you guys think separates us from the rest of the animal kingdom? What can humans do that other animals cannot?

I took a ""Theory of Human Uniqueness"" class at my university. The theory states that the most unique human ability is our elite throwing skill. No other animal can throw an object as well as a human. Our big brains, our ability to cooperate with the non-kin, our ability to afford to take years to bring up our young are all the outcome of our elite ability to throw.

The name of my professor was Paul M. Bingham and this is his theory:
#Human_evolutionary_biology

""He has developed the theory further in a self-published book, Death from a Distance and the Birth of a Humane Universe (BookSurge, 2009). This work builds on W.D. Hamilton’s theory of kin selection (Benefit x Relatedness &gt; Cost) and posits that the Homo genus evolved when an ancestral organism developed the ability to effectively manage non-kin conflicts of interests by lowering the cost of coercion between non-kin individuals (Benefit &gt; Cost of Coercion + Cost of Cooperation).

...

According to his theory, the cost of coercing a cheating individual in a cooperative effort, otherwise known as the free-rider problem, was lowered when a precursor species to modern humans developed a way to threaten adult con-specifics from a distance by evolving the ability to throw. This diffused the risk to the predator formulated by Lanchester's Square Law. It proposes that we evolved the ability to repel predators and scavenge their kills in the African savannah. This was later adapted as threat projection towards free-riding con-specifics in non kin cooperative groups.""

Do not really know them, our first meeting was not so good mostly my fault, i reacted badly when i found them visiting my appartement without my permission (the landlord decided to let them in without asking me, really pissed me off). We mostly just nod hello when we run into each other in the hallway at this point, so i guess mostly neutral.

Anyways last week the mother knocked on my kitchen door, this in itself is pretty unusual since the kitchen door leads out to the fire escape that neither of us uses.

She proceeds to tell me that her child is locked into the bathroom of her appartement and that she herself is locked out (this is in montreal, 15 below wearing only a t-shirt and shorts) and needs my help to get him out.

She has not keys and wants me to crawl into the bathroom using the window and break the door down.

At this point i take responsability for not thinking, i was faced with a very histerical mother and a crying child and my first instinct was to help them immidiatly and not do what i should of done and ask questions and more then likely call the police to have them sort it out.

What i did was to crawl into the bathroom and break the door down. This was not easy, i assumed the door was simply locked and the kid was not able to unlock it but it was not the case, turns out there was a deabolt on the outside of the door, bottom line the kid (and possibly his mother) was locked inside the bathroom.

Now i do not have children but it seems to me that you should never lock them inside a bathroom no matter what. I am also worried that maybe the mother was locked inside the bathroom with her child possibly by the husband.

I am unsure what to do or even if i should do anything. The way i see it if i don't do anything and this is a case of neglect and abuse i could be endangering the childs life, if i choose to call the authorities and i am wrong i could possibly make their lives a living hell for no good reason.

Not sure what to do.

Bun B - 'No Mixtape' (2010),"



After a short hiatus from the game Bun B started off 2010, or screwthousand and ten as all rappers from Texas say, rippin' and rhymin' like he never left.

The new year added a few new leaks, then Bun released a brand new mixtape available above, and he sounds like the youngster we all fell in love with (if you are over the age of 20) well over a decade ago. 

He was likely tired of grinding for over 20 years, sometimes without Pimp because he was incarcerated for three years from '02-'05, and needed some time to reflect and figure out a future plan for himself.

It seems like Bun used the time off to refresh his mind and sharpen his skills because Bun B is back. Something has gotten into Bun in 2010, as he has a new inspiration in his voice we have not heard since Pimp was still alive. 

He gets his old school on his new mixtape (No Mixtape) with a classic remix of Outkast's 2 Dope Boyz, then lets all the kids know whats up with his thrashing of Goin' In and politely reminds us who Weezy's favorite rapper of all time is. 

Bun plans on releasing The Naked Soul of Sweet James Jones, Pimp C's third studio album later this year.

**Design Brief:**

A steel structure is designed to work with two wall types. Insulated aluminum panels brace the side walls of the structure while creating a thermal break outside of the structure. Double glass curtain walls on the front and rear façades create an air buffer and provide vertical ventilation space for air to flow between floors. Steel cross bracing between the glass walls prevents the structure from racking. Steel I-beams support precast concrete floor modules which span 24’ and include radiant heating, cool air supply, and wiring chases. The grid of window mullions allows both interior partitions and floor-to-ceiling heights to be adjusted in 4’ increments.",architecture

what to do about an extortionist roommate?,"long time reader first time poster...

So my roommate payed me a sum of 1100 to take two classes for him last semester. i attended class, sat for exams, etc for him the entire semester in each of the two classes. At the end I/he came out with a B in one class and a D the other. At my uni a D is not a passing grade so he was upset, as would be expected, and I honestly felt bad for the guy (though not too bad he was a prick about it the entire time). So at the beginning of this semester, upon his demand, I payed him back some of the money for the class I got the D in (all total, including my ""services"", the class cost him ~1000$ and I payed him back 300$). That's the backstory.

Now suddenly (a month after having settled the entire thing) he wants all of his money back because I didn't get an A in the other class and got the D in the first. More importantly he's threatening me with bodily harm (""i'll kill you"" while making a slicing motion across his neck with a steak knife) . 

So I don't know what to do. I'm not going to pay him (it would be difficult to reason why it's just not to pay him in a situation when we've essentially both a committed a crime but I feel  I don't feel like I can go to the police because eventually it will incriminate me and I'll be expelled from the University.

Yes. In this regard religion is good. But. Why do people choose to worship in the first place? It can be shown that poverty level and religion are related, proportional. Within a group, greater destitution equals greater religiousness, period. 

Does religion (god) make people poor, no. *Does poverty make people religious,* **yes**. Religiousness is a symptom of poverty, period.

Conversely, the wealthier people are the less religious they tend to be. Non-belief is a symptom of wealth. **Note:** You may be well-to-do and religious, but statistically your peers are less likely to be the same. How did you become religious? Probably through curiosity, your parents, friends, relatives, or through *crisis*. Which is essentially an impoverished facet of your life.

Why does god punish the group that believes in him more? He doesn't. But why do people who believe less do better? They don't. Believing less is not the cause it's a symptom.

Shouldn't god bless the group that believes in him more? If he existed, yeah he should unless he was sadistic.

You can do 1 of 4 things:

1. Consider what I've said logically. 
2. Argue that god does not manifest physically (Jesus did, miracles happen) or something vague like, ""He works in mysterious ways.""
3. Create a bastardized interpretation of Christianity that seems to make sense, but is theologically incorrect.
4. Pussy out say that you will pray for me and that I need help and hope that I find god.

I, an atheist, concede that there is good that comes from religion (theraputic effects). The ideological face, the one that spawns war, terrorism, hate, xenophobia, intolerance is the one I fight.

I donated $100 to Direct Relief International on behalf on Reddit. This morning I received this email. Please tell me this is not true.,"Hi Mr.  ----------

Thank you for asking about us.  Gerald told me you had emailed after learning we had been sent to Haiti to help with the relief effort.  Anyway, Shanklin and I are back.
 
We flew in at 3 AM Sunday to the scene of such incredible destruction on one side, and enormous ineptitude and criminal neglect on the other.

Port Au Prince is in ruins. The rest of the country is fairly intact. Our team was a rescue team and we carried special equipment that locates people buried under the rubble. There are easily 200,000 dead, the city smells like a charnal house. The UN was there for 5 years doing apparently nothing but wasting US taxpayers money. The ones I ran into were either incompetent or outright anti-American.  Most are French or French speakers, worthless, every damned one of them. While 1800 rescuers were ready willing and able to leave the airport and go do our jobs, we were stopped by the UN and USAID (another organization full of little OBama cronnies and communists that openly speak against America). These two organizations exemplared their parochialism by:

USAID, when in control of all inbound flights, had food and water flights stacked up all the way to Miami waiting to land, yet allowed Geraldo Rivera, Anderson Cooper and a host of other left wing news puppies to land.

(Jamison said you told him when you heard Bill Clinton was headed that way and you believed everything would stop while he toured the area and ""looked"" concerned.  You were so right).  Pulled all the security off the rescue teamsso that he and his wife could have the grand tour, whille we sat unable to get to people trapped in the rubble.

Stacked enough food and water for the relief over at the side of the airfield then put a guard on it while we stayed dehydrated and wouldn't release a drop of it to the rescuers.

No shower facilities to decontaminate after digging or moving corpses all day, except for the FEMA teams who brought their own shower and decon equipment, as well as air conditioned tents.

No latrine facilities, unless digging a hole. If you set up a latrine everyone was trying to use it.

I watched a 25 year old Obama appointee with the USAID shrieking hysterically, berating a full bird colonel in the Air Force, because he countermanded her orders, whille trying to unscrew the air pattern. ""You don't know what your President wants! The military isn't in charge here, we are!"" (thats an understatement)

If any of you are thinking of giving money to the Haitian relief, or to the UN don't waste your money.  I believe we have enough issues here and your money is being wasted.  You read it right, wasted.

Bad place, bad situation, but a perfect look at the new world order in action. New Orleans magnified a thousand times. Haiti doesn't need democracy, what Haiti needs is Papa Doc. That's not just my opinion, that is what virtually every Haitian we talked with said. The French-run UN treat us the same as when we were a colony, at least Papa Doc ran the country.

Oh, and as a last slap in the face the last four of us had to take US Airways home from Phoenix. They slapped me with a $90 dollar baggage charge for the four of us. The girl at the counter was almost in tears because she couldn't give us a discount or she would lose her job. Pass that on to the flying public.

Take care.

"During a time of crisis and growth, those who unite and carry on are critical to the mission.","We are all part of the birth of a new social movement, a new grassroots organization, and a new political party. In the past few days, because our party’s age can still be measured in days, leaders have emerged and disappeared. **They will continue to do so, as the burden of leadership becomes increasingly complex and time-consuming as we continue to evolve.**

We experienced a huge surge in numbers, thanks in part to levmyshkin’s inspiring first post and the novel appeal of our name.

We are new. We are building something from the ground up, and before us is a difficult road. There is much to be done, and many leaders are rising up to fill the gaps. Do not worry yourself overmuch about a lack of clear leadership, **leaders and solutions will emerge.** Those with particular skills (or the desire to develop them) are already spearheading important movements for change within the party. *Feel like your voice isn’t being heard?

Because we are acting on good faith, **I believe every voice can, and will be heard.**

Amongst other things, we should all be encouraged by the several “real life” meetings that have already taken place, in particular, LA’s recent meet-up. 

Important work still needs to be done. Difficult transitions must be made. If you’re discouraged, read up on the early history of any grassroots organization. Experience will show that **these challenges are normal – and if we get past them, our hope to make significant change can be realized.**

At what point do you first remember questioning the idea of God?,"First vivid memory I have is sitting on the steps outside my house, talking to my Mormon friend, we got to talking about God and what we imagined him to be like.
I latched onto the idea of him receiving prayers (or wishes as I called them at that age) and wondered how this could be implemented.
I took my friend as more of an expert on God as she went to Church once a week. I asked her if God had a machine(something like a fax machine is what I had in mind) that received all the wishes, and there was some kind of computer to process them, and deliver the ""best"" ones, as he obviously would never have time to read and act on all the billions he got each day.
She laughed at me and said God isn't a machine, when I tried to explain no, does he HAVE a machine, she told me I didn't understand and would burn in hell for it, then ran off crying home.

I lost respect for my friend and probably the idea of a concept you can't question without upsetting people that day.
Judging by which house we were in, I must have been under 10..and yet even by that age I had decided the whole thing just could not be feasible in my world view at all, and whenever I tried to make it so was always just told I was wrong and I had to love and understand or I would be punished.

I thought the most powerful person was probably the most intelligent (as an adult we now know this is often not the case but it made sense to me as a child).
I questioned why would be most intelligent person/being/whatever be so offended by others wanting to understand? Unless it had no answers and was threatened, and if it had no answers as to how it existed in this capacity, then perhaps it didn't and that is why those who insisted it did exist but couldn't answer anything in a sensible way.

My family are Christian and I went to schools that were about 80% Muslim, I was made to feel an idiot for not understanding and loving God in one shape or another for many years, it wasn't till I was around 16 I had the guts to  insist what I took as my more logical approach to the issue as something other than ignorance.

I love communities like r/atheism because outside of the Internet and the odd person I meet I still feel so alone in this respect, as my mum pities me and I am forever losing friends when they ""discover"" I am an atheist, even though I never hide it! Most of my friends are spiritual if not religious, and just can't seem to grasp the face I lack the ability to, and am not willing to subscribe to what I see as ""magic and fairy tales"" in some way or another :(

IAE sick of Mormon hypocrisy and lack of Integrity ?,"I was LDS (mormon) since 14 (I am now 36) and left the church at age 28. If you are going to read/comment here Im going to assume you know Mormon doctrine pretty well preferably from being or having been LDS.

So I go to the gas station yesterday (sunday) to pick up some drinks and chips. I pull up next to a van DECKED OUT in BYU stuff...here we go, I thought. Not only did I see the couple inside with their BYU sweatshirts on buying Pepsi (not caffeine free) but also a family of 6 completely dressed in church attire obviously coming home from church (and in Utah its pretty much a sure bet they are mormon and not some other religion that doesnt teach not buying or working on sun) all buying a treat, dad with 2 pepsis in hand-again not caffeine free. Mind you there is the occasional ""Ox in the Mire"" situation, however if this were the rare case for this family where they were about to run out of gas and they were living the faith and being an example for their kids they would not all be in there buying a treat. Not to mention, now that I am out of the church, I see this ALL THE TIME on sunday, because when I was a faithful member I DIDN'T GO TO THE STORE ON SUNDAY LIKE A GOOD LITTLE MORMON!

This and other member related hypocrisies was the beginning of my questioning the church. People say ""dont judge the gospel by its members"" but am I to assume that the people who wrote the bible and Book of Mormon were above this type of human behavior? Yeah they were supposedly writing the word of God but if such a large number of members can't even keep simple rules why would I trust them with huge important tasks that I base my whole earthly and eternal life on?

When I was in the church I can say with confidence that I was near perfect as a church member. I attended church every week, didnt buy or work on sunday, held family home evening, did my visiting teaching, encouraged my husb to do all of his duties, went to the temple regularly, brought meals to people, held callings and fulfilled them well, prepared my lessons, paid tything, didnt swear, lived word of wisdom, didnt hike my garments up to suit my immodest clothes, read my scriptures, prayed, taught my kids the gospel, was honest in my dealings with my fellow men, didnt steal (including coiping CDs and DVDs which many so called good mormons do), etc, etc, etc!

I didnt join the church because my family were members. I joined at 14 on my own because I wanted to live what the gospel taught and be surrounded by a group of people who also did the same. I can leave room for small error once in a while but as time progressed I saw through the facade that many many mormons wear and lost more and more faith in the people and their religion as my disappointment grew and grew until i was so let down and sad that I decided looking within for faith, morality, and goodness in the universe was more effective and fulfilling than being a part of a group whose founders had a lot of good and wholesome ideas bundled up with their own human bullshit.",DoesAnybodyElse

"Reddit, I need to stop or slow down gambling","First of all, long time user/contributer/poster/reader, and I apologize for the throwaway account but I'd like to retain some form of anonymity here with this.

Long story short, I'd like to stop gambling. It's not so much the financial part of it -- although that is a contributing factor. I just don't think it's healthy to go blow $1,200 (or around there) a couple/few times a month.

I'd give 100% financial control to my wife, but I do need some control of it or bills will get forgotten -- and I'll still find a way to get the money if I want to.

I enjoy the social aspect of sitting at a Blackjack or Ultimate Texas Hold'em, and playing. Talking with the dealer and other players, and just making bets. I play right, I'm not reckless with my gambling or anything -- I just seem to always hit bad cards.


I play Blackjack by a specific set of rules and have done very well in years past -- it just seems that within the last year I've hit some of the worst runs of cards I've ever seen. I bet anywhere from $3-50/hand depending on my bankroll and how the night is going/how I'm feeling.


I'd like to find some ways to NOT gamble so much or even at all. I've tried distracting myself, but I generally still get that urge and think ""Well, maybe I can make it worth the trip!"" but usually end up leaving empty pocketed.

My wife knows and doesn't seem to care too much. We do okay with money and as long as we can pay the bills and eat she seems fine. 

I'm embarrassed by what appears to my addiction to gambling, and I have too much damned pride for gambler's anonymous.

Any methods that have worked for other gamblers? When I get the urge, I try to remember what it feels like to lose so much, but then I remember what it's like to cash out $24,000 after an insane run as well.

I enjoy gambling, but I know it's not healthy and the money could be better used.

UT plans to shut down renown music venue because the venue doesn't make them enough money.,"For those of you not in Austin, and those that are here but don't know this place, the Cactus Cafe is a little bar and music venue located on UT's campus. The venue has been around for over 30 years, and it is one of the few music venues dedicated to music, not profit, scenesters, or glory. The worst thing about this complaint the university is making about the Cafe is that they don't make enough money. Now, while this would normally make sense, in this case it is a bit tricky. The higher levels at the university don't like the fact that there is a FULL SERVICE bar on campus, so, the university prohibits the Cactus from any type of advertising. Most people at UT only learn about the Catcus from friends that have been there. If the school would rethink and allow the Cactus to advertise, then the situation would turn around quickly.",reddit.com

Where I think the problem falls.,"This is where I think we run into a problem when discussing blanket legalization and government regulation of distribution:

No matter what the personal viewpoints of these leaders and congressmen we elect actually are, they have too much money coming in from all of these special interest groups (big pharma, alcohol, tobacco, textiles) that would disappear if they voted in favor of big bad MARIJUANA. Sadly, logic and reason are not what govern our country. Money and power bitches. The country as a whole does not believe their propaganga. We are ready for a change! But no matter whats good for the country, if it doesn't please the big industries, forget about it. (We could have mass produced alternative fuel vehicles YEARS ago, cheaply, but OIL couldn't have that.)

Who would EVER buy their first pack of cigarettes? Seriously think about it. Game over for big tobacco.

Alcohol would suffer a bit, but will never disappear. If anything, maybe people would drink more rationally. AND I think it would lead to a boost in production of quality, rather than quantity. (Gotta have my dank brews)

Pharma. Let's be honest, we all know what they're out for. I'd say only about 50% of all prescriptions have an ailment that actually warrants their distribution.

And it's not just these few. Hemp is cheaper and easier to grow than cotton or any others for that matter. It can be more efficiently turned into paper and other products also. Starting as racial supression, today it's almost depsised for it's greatness.",trees
Game Idea: GTA MMO but it's free to play as the cops.,"I realize that there are some mods out there for the PC GTA games to allow multiple players raising hell at once--and of course the new GTA games have multiplayer options--but we've all dreamed of a true MMO version.  I guess the concern would be that the city would be a clusterfuck (a beautiful one) 24/7.  My stab at a solution: More cops--the natural GTA enemy.  I get that you'd have gangs and thugs of all sorts running everywhere, so who'd want to play a cop?  Answer: Everyone who doesn't want to pay.  They'll get standardized weapons and vehicles, etc.  And they get the chance to ruin the paying players day.  

Has something like this ever been done?  Is it a shitty idea?

Edit 1: ""free to play"" should be read as free as in money free--you don't have to pay as a cop, while the (normal?) criminal players DO pay.  I didn't mean you COULD be the cops, but a simple reworking of the tiered pay or no-pay system.

Edit 2: I don't work for Rockstar games, and don't develop video games professionally.

Edit 3: I suppose I should have been clearer in the original post.  I was attempting to create a unique playing model by finding a way to compensate for ALL the havoc a GTA player could wreak without having to instance off the action--this would allow GTA cities to have 100's of players in it as once--by having many cops that could supplement the bots to keep a lid on things.  In GTA world, this would add incentive to drive like a normal person to avoid the eyes of the law, and not kill everything in sight, (well, sometimes).  Regardless of the specific game format, the ability to play a limited, tertiary role in the game FOR FREE while allowing people to try the game that way, providing a fun, unique model for everyone I thought was an original idea.  My original post did not make this clear--for that I apologize.",gaming

Grundlemuncher - Peppermint Mocha Stout,"I'm just getting into homebrewing (I've done lots of brewing before.. but most hobo jug wine and such under my college dorm bed).  I did an oatmeal stout a few months ago that turned out pretty well (partial extract), and I'm wanting to experiment a bit.  

Enter grundlemuncher.  I was planning on doing this brew around the holidays but obviously its a bit late.  Here is my plan.  I ordered the imperial stout kit (partial extract) from NB.  Instead of topping it off to 5 gals to ferment, I'm only going to top it to about 4.5 or so.  

I will then brew up a half gallon of COLD brewed coffee (Probably use about a pound of beans).  To this cold-brewed coffee, I will add the peppermint flavoring and chocolate.  I would like the cold-brewed mix to be a good balance of coffee/chocolate/peppermint before adding it to the beer before bottling.  In this way, I'm hoping that the beer will not be overly minty/chocolatey or coffee-y.  
Here is the big question though:  What about doubling up the chocolate as a priming sugar?  Assuming I can get something without any preservatives, and measure out an amount by weight, do you think its feasible?  What other ways do you recommend I get that chocolate flavor into grundlemuncher?",Homebrewing

"I've scoured the internet, learned alot, but nothing beats reddit. So reddit, what are your tips for losing weight?","I suppose it'd probably be helpful to know my ""specs"". I'm 6'3, around 235 pounds, and I have a medium frame. I've set my target weight, at the lowest, to 210, which people tell me would be almost unhealthy. While I appreciate any and all advice concerning weight loss, I do have a couple specific questions. 

- Sometimes when I wake up in the morning the weigh myself, my weight will be DRASTICALLY different than the day before. For example, on saturday I weighed myself and I was 236. The next day? I was 231. I had worked out and followed my high fiber diet (which isnt really a diet, just all high fiber foods). What can explain this? I always take these results with a pinch of salt because its simply impossible. 

- How do I know if I'm working out correctly? I feel sore afterwards in some situations, but in others I don't feel very sore at all. 
     (followup)- Should I work out while I'm sore? What If i'm only slightly sore? 

- Is Muscle Memory a good thing or a bad thing? 

- In my current diet, I'm trying to eat foods that are high in either protein or fiber, and the only other thing I'm really taking into account is sugar. Is this acceptable if I'm trying to lose weight? 

- My preferred form of cardio is a bike machine, which is so easy to me after ten minutes that it doesnt even feel like work. Is it ok to do only one kind of cardio? 
    -(followup) I currently do 35 minutes on ""Level 4"" (out of twelve levels of intensity). My mindset is that I want to built up to 90, but increase very slowly. Is this alright? 

- Furthermore, Should I do cardio before strength training or vice versa? Does it make a difference?

Does anyone think this web idea is viable?,"I had this idea recently after my parents spent a good 6 months going to offices, soliciting bids, and getting quotes for several different remodeling projects in our home. My idea was to try and consolidate this process. while using some basic economic principles to attempt to benefit the consumers, as well as the contractors who perform the job. My idea was an eBay-similar site, where people would post a job they needed done, and various contractors would bid on that job, similar to how big government contracts are auctioned off. The competition would certainly benefit those who need the job, and the contractors would benefit by having major sources of work posted on the site. I talked about it with my parents and they had several criticisms which I gave additional ideas to solve. 

First Problem : How do you make sure bids are from real Contractors?
My Answer : Well, to be able to bid on the site, you would have to be approved by the site as a real contractor, and as you use the site, the reviews from the jobs carried out have to meet a certain positive ratio for them to continue bidding. 

Second Problem : A lot of times contracting jobs need an in depth inspection before a quote can be given.
Answer : For those particular jobs, an ""open house"" can be held, where registered contractors who are interested are given a time and date where they can all inspect a particular site. Then, at a certain time after the ""open house"", bidding begins.

The bids would not be binding like ebay. Contractors could include additional information about their bid and why it should be chosen ahead of the others. This information would be public to all other bidders. After bidding closed, the poster would have time to mull their options and choose a contractor. 

Anyone else think this idea is good? I know it isn't the next big internet thing/multi-million website, but can it get off the ground? If you are really interested, I'd need help starting it up, I'm only 16, and my only programming/web design experience is the AP Comp Sci AB course and designing my club's website. We'd need regional managers to register the contractors in metropolitan areas, as well as a lawyer to draw up the incorporation and terms of service. An idea to get the company started would be to distribute information to local Realtors, who would get a small commission for getting their clients with recently purchased homes or homes to be sold to use the site.

"Reddit Vets:  My 6 year old cat is ill and I question my vets diagnosis, so can you take a look?","My cat a 6 year old adopted female has had running eyes for the past 3-4 months.  The discharge is usually from the left eye and is usually a greyish or whitish mucus, though sometimes it is yellow/green.  Along with here running eyes she also sneezes a lot.  

We brought her to a local vet 2 weeks ago where she was 9.9lbs and had normal lungs and temperature.  No blood work or xrays were done then.  We were told that due to the lack of eye scars and ulcers it was not feline herpes. Even though her symptoms are directly in line with feline herpes.

The doctor gave her a steroid shot of prednisone as well as two antibiotics(one liquid by mouth and one eye drip).  He also have us 2mg tablets of prednisone to spilt in half and give 2x a day.

We followed the recommended charge and for the first week she still sneezed and still had discharge but it was severely decreased from the normal amounts.  About one exact week after the prednisone shot her eyes started to discharge a lot more and she got kinda blue.  We kept with the antibiotics and the prednisone tabs and then a week after that she got really bad.  This was 3 days ago, she then became extremely congested and didn't even eat or drink for two days.

Yesterday(Sunday the 3rd of the extreme congestion) night we had trouble giving her her prednisone tablet, so we broke it up and put it in sardine juice but she didn't really eat it.  we then took the juice in a baby dropper and have it to her that way, but cant really be 100% sure she got the prednisone(1mg).  Though right before this we gave her sardines and some water and she started to be herself.  The extreme congestion cleared up and she really was good.  Then overnight she got a little more blue, but still much better then those 2 last days.


Today Monday we went to the vet and he took blood and a xray.  Lungs and temperature were normal.  Xray was also completely clean.  Blood tests showed slight leukopenia as well as low levels of creatinine.  Like I said both were not extremely low but low enough for the doctor to take concern. 

My doctor now wants to run thousands of dollars worth of tests and we are just a but unsure.   My cat was much better both physically, mentally and emotionally before we went to see the vet.  We expected Herpes or allergies, but now the doctor is talking about  lymphoma.

I am interested in some other vets takes on this situation, and are low on funds.  The current visits have just about made us broke, and I hope we don't have thousands of dollars left to spend.

Our 10 man group has no clue what we are doing wrong, but our poor offtank is having the hardest time trying to kite the big slimes around the room.

Update:  Had a pretty bad group, our OT was slow on Gunship and an newbie kept starting it when people were afk to have about 5 wipes on gunship.  After that we never got back until monday when we downed saurfang and that was it.  So hopefully we can put together a pro group tonight and get up to plague wing.  thanks again for all the advice.

Update:  Had a great group this past week, and got 5 bosses down in one night. Tried rotface last night.  Seemed like our offtank got the kiting down no problem.  We just kept getting over run by slimes after about 4-5 minutes.  Was wondering if this was a DPS issue, of if the slimes are always crazy?",wow

I just got Metroid Prime Trilogy and i have to say that Bioshock has nothing on this...,"When people talk about Bioshock, usually the word immersive is thrown around a lot. I defiantly felt that when I played it. The world, characters, and gameplay all came together for a tremendous experience. The list assumes after your first play through, not on repeats. As we all know, any game you play more than once, loses some of the wonder it has.

However, after playing through the first Metroid Prime, I can say that Bioshock's immersion pales in comparison to MP. It can be broken down as follows:

1. Character: Bioshock is a FPS, so you automatically feel like you are the character. That is about as far as it goes, though. In MP, on the other hand, you are Samus. You're in her helmet, you see what she sees, you react as if you are Samus. You scan, shoot, jump, dodge all as if it is really you. There really is no comparison when it comes to feeling like the character.

2. World: I will say that Bioshock has a incredibly detailed world that is done incredibly well. However, i felt the locations started to feel kind of the same after a while. ""Ooh, another water drenched hallway...yawn"". MP's world is also very detailed and well done, but the big difference is that there is different areas that feel different, but come together in the end. You have a lava cavern under the surface, chozo ruins above, an arctic area, and a mining area. All of these areas work together to make the planet believable, but feel different every time you step off an elevator. 

3. Weapons: I will concede here and say that shooting lightning and fire from your hands is awesome. MP has great weapons, but the sheer awesomeness of Bioshocks powers help edge this ahead.

4. Exploration: The only reason to explore in Bioshock is to find recordings and the usual FPS fare (money, ammo, etc). In MP, you want to explore. You need to see every square inch of the world to find every expansion for missles, power bombs, and energy. You want to explore just to see the world that waas made and to experience every nook and cranny.

So there you have it. I can still appreciate Bioshock, but when it comes to full immersion in a video game, Metroid Prime is king (or queen, Samus is a girl you know)",gaming

Realistically Drawn Anime?,"**TL;DR:** Looking for smoothly animated anime that is fairly realistically drawn - like Ghost in the Shell.

I've perused a few of the discussions here, and i've come up with some possible series to check out (Claymore, Black Lagoon, Death Frenzy) - but nobody was really asking the direct question i was hoping to have answered, so i thought i'd see if anyone had anything to add.

Can anyone give me a few suggestions for an anime series that is fairly realistically drawn? Preferably dark and bloody, but i'd just like to see what the options are- regardless of genre.

I'm in love with Ghost in the Shell, and i enjoyed Samurai Champloo and Cowboy Bebop.  I enjoyed Hellsing Ultimate - but even that has sections that are drawn in that caricature way that i hate.  Giant eyes, exaggerated mouths, stuttering animation to show emotion, etc, are all huge turn offs for me.  I cringe when those kinds of things come up, and i refuse to watch anything with that consistent style.

Also, most of the supernatural things drive me crazy.  Silly demons, huge swords, magic - i just can't get into it.  I guess i'd like to imagine that the story is plausible (at least mostly).

Does that ring any bells for anyone?


**EDIT:** Thanks everyone!  I really appreciate all the suggestions.  I kinda thought i was going to get a bunch of hate - either because my listed realistic(ish) favorites are the ""mainstream anime"", or because someone might think i just didn't look hard enough on my own.  But i did look, and didn't come up with anything i could be sure of.  I've taken the suggestions, and without doing anymore research, i've ordered a few.  I prefer to know as little as possible before starting a new series (or a movie, for that matter).

Is capitalism possible without consumerism?,"Some recent reading has really got me thinking about consumerism, and just the amount of time, energy, and resources that are wasted in the big treadmill that comes out of it.  But my thinking has gone deeper into why consumerism has come about in the first place, and as a result, I'm finding that I'm questioning if it's possible for capitalist economies to get out of the cycle of consumerism?

That's what I'm questioning here - is it possible for a capitalist society, in an environment of plenty*, to exist without falling into consumerism?  I can't imagine it any other way.  Humanity has become so efficient at using resources to provide the basics for everyone that only a small percentage of people are involved in doing so.  Thus we have a large percentage of people who are able to work, but are not needed to provide for everyone else - but as we're a capitalist society, those people need to work to make the money to buy the things they require to survive, so they then have to make and provide things and services that aren't needed.  These then have a need to be sold to people, and so on.

In other words, it looks like that because we've chosen an economy that requires people to buy the necessities of life with money, as if they're scarce resources, then we need to find reasons for everyone to work to earn that money.  People are pushed to consume to make sure that others get paid to produce, just because that's the only way that most people can have the jobs they need to stay alive.  If the majority of people were to stop all that excess consumption, it seems like our economy would fall apart, with masses of people out of work, because we've come to depend on an economy of consumption.

Am I wrong here?  I'd really be interested in seeing how capitalism could work without this reliance on consumption - and even better if there are ideas as to how to get there.


(*I want to call out the environment of plenty, because it does seem that a society where the work of everyone is required just to provide enough for everyone to live, would end up not being consumerist, because there isn't room for it.  I don't know, however, if such a state is stable.  But that's not what I'm really interested in here.)",Anticonsumption

I need advice on how to date a girl that has been sexually abused. What's the best protocol here for a more intimate relationship?,"We have been together for two years and everything is perfect, except for when it comes to sex.

She was raped by her last boyfriend, and it has apparently left her very traumatized. She can accept passionate kisses and hugs, but not too much or too long. I can hold her when we sleep, but only properly, and she gets very nervous if I imply a more physical interest. It is very difficult for her to even talk about what she feels.

I love this girl with all my heart, and I would wait until the end of time to have sex with her If I had to, but I also don't want her too feel this way about it. I feel sorry for her, and I also feel like I'm not really helping when I feel like wanting to squeeze her to pieces because she's so damn cute.

I know that all of this will improve over time, and that she'll hopefully feel safe enough with me some day, but I still want to know if there is anything that I could do in a more active way?

I'd like to hear some advice from the perspective of other girls who's had bad experiences. What has helped you to feel alright about physical contact again? When do you feel the most vulnerable and the most confident about yourselves?

How do I talk to her about sex without making her feel like I'm expecting something from her? She doesn't come to me about it, so I feel that maybe it's up to me, but I don't want to come off as stressing.

Are there some good questions that I could ask her about what she is going through, that could give me a better understanding of her, without making her feel like she's giving away too much of herself?

Also, I don't want her to be afraid of making me aroused, and I don't want to feel guilty when I do.

I've never haggled all that much, but I was pretty pleased with getting so much off the original price - I first had him do a price match which dropped about $150-$200, then I had him toss in a free blu-ray player, and then after that, I managed to drop the blu-ray player for another discount of about $150.

"Reddit, an inquiry into the issues of rectums","So, this is kind of embarrassing, hence the throw-away account, but I had to ask.

Recently, within the past few months, my rectum has been really itchy.  The pattern I've noticed is that when it gets itchy (pretty frequently throughout the day), I'll go to the bathroom and wipe, and there tends to be some fecal matter that's come out.  Now, I wipe thoroughly when I go in the first place.  I've even been using baby wipes as something moist to help make sure everything is as clean as possible.  But this problem persists.

A couple years ago I ended up with what was basically a yeast infection around the same area and I had some Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Dipropionate Cream prescribed, which cleared it up nicely.  This time, using it hasn't really made a difference.  Also, I was on (for an internal yeast infection) diflucan a month or two back for a couple weeks, which would have eradicated any yeast in the area - but the problem still persisted and persists.

Is there something that this could be?  Is it a medical issue?  My health insurance is in a transition phase right now so I'm somewhat at a loss for what to do.

I told her we should probably start by playing around in the shower or something so it wouldnt be as dirty or hard to clean.

I was thinking I should start with just some fingers and see if she likes it, but i was hoping you all had some other helpful tips!

"My gaming idea, google streetview finally made it possible?","Ever since the GPS in-car displays came out I've had an idea for a racing game that I thought was revolutionary (at the time). Though fast forward several years later it still hasn't been utilized...

My idea, generate your own true to life scale race courses, based on your city / route... Having multiple paths etc all would be customizable. Basically the idea was to have a program able to render a racetrack based off of GPS data (Now Google street view has much more accurate information than the satellite / GPS). 

The whole idea was that the consumer would be interested in re-creating routes they often take, to work, school, to the next town. across the country etc.. Then be able to take a variety of vehicles and see just how fast they could get to their destination when they don't have to worry about full life consequences.

This would work really well on the PC where you could render your own tracks and even customize the landscape in post.

What's the craziest way to knock over a guarded grocery store in Postapocalyptia?,"To clarify, the world ended a couple of weeks ago and about five to ten well-armed people are guarding a grocery store to live off the supplies until the government swoops in to save them.

First batch of beer!  But it may have problems?,"Hey guys, this is my first post here, and I'd like to hear your input on my first batch of ale, which seems to be acting a little strangely.  We cooked it up two days ago, and right now, it's in the primary fermenter (a glass carboy) with the waterlock (I think that's the word for it) bobbing away.  However, there's a solid inch-thick layer of foam and crud on top of the beer!  It looks very thick and persistent with small bubbles, like sea-foam, and there's bits of hops and shit stuck in it.  I was just wondering if this is normal (to have thick, small-bubble foam on top), or if maybe I messed up by cooking it wrong, allowing contamination, adding ingredients at the wrong stage, etc.

It's an amber ale made from a kit (one can of malt extract syrup, and two bags of powdered malt extract).  We added 1 oz of hops at the beginning of the boil, and another near the end, as well as some orange zest about 25 minutes in (an experiment), and boiled it for ~35 minutes.  We didn't have a pot quite big enough for the recipe (we had a 6.6L pot for 1.5 gallons of water) so we split the boil between two pots and then recombined in the big pot after some of the water evaporated.  We didn't filter between the boil and the primary fermenter (I think this may be the problem), thinking we'd just siphon it through a filter into the secondary fermenter.  Another potential problem: we didn't take the temperature of the wort before adding yeast, but it seemed ""cool enough"" - however, the beer is fermenting nicely so the yeast seems happy enough.  We made sure to sterilize the shit out of everything (with C-Brite), but maybe we messed up (though as a biology student I'd feel bad if my sterile technique weren't up to snuff).

Should I be worried about my first batch of ale?  Have you guys ever had nasty foam, and did it make your beer taste bad?  Is it contaminated and should I start over?  

Hopefully this is normal, and I'll have a great batch of hoppy, orangey (maybe even orangered) ale in a month!  Thanks for your advice guys, and hopefully I can make r/homebrewing a new home for me and my brew.",Homebrewing

Reddit ladies: Ever lactated for absolutely no reason whatsoever? My GF is...,"So the girl was inspecting her breast yesterday morning, and gave it a small ""milking"" movement. 'lo and behold, a white liquid came out of her nipple. She jumped over to the other one, and gave the same movement. Yup, some there too.


First reaction was that she was pregnant. Not unwelcome, but unexpected. Went and got a test kit from the supermarket, and it came back negative. While she went out and shopped for that, I did some googling around. From what I could see, milk coming from both breasts isn't usually indicative of a physical problem but might be hormonal (pituary gland yada yada).


Just so happened that I had a doctors appointment later that day for an unrelated matter, so I rang up and had the appointment time extended. When we told the doctor about it, he seemed completely unphased. We mentioned earlier in the appointment that my sister had recently had a baby (about a month ago), and that my GF is feeling very clucky. Doc has sent her for blood tests to be sure, but doesnt think it's anything serious.


Other things to note:

 * Yes, there's a chance she could be pregnant. She was off the pill for a week and a half, and we were having unprotected sex. Went back on the pill about a week ago

 * If she is, it's definitely not unwanted :)

 * Googling suggests lactating so early in a pregnancy (1-2 weeks) is exceedingly rare, moreso for a first pregnancy

 * Tastes kinda salty, little tangy

 * One boob has more than the other

Should Tebow give up on the NFL altogether and just play rugby?,"Tebow, and the University of Florida, sacrificed his NFL career when they decided it was more important to win college championships than prepare him for the NFL. They focused on his strengths and did everything they could to enhance them and they did everything to ignore and dismiss his weaknesses like they didn't exist. Well, they do exist and they are every bit as visible today as they were four years ago.  
He's proven that after fours years of college football he's either incapable of or unwilling to learn how to throw a football. He is not an NFL quarterback.  
If he wants to stay true to his ethos he should do something that would impact the entire world of sport - a huge part of our worldwide collective cuture - not just impact the world of sport in the US. He should stop playing American football and start playing rugby. He should stop playing a sport he's not that good at and play one that could make him a global icon in ways the NFL could never do(and would never do given their team-first marketing approach).  
The NFL will not change it's style to accommodate his skills. It didn't happen with Vince Young, it's not going to happen with Tebow. 
In the NFL Tebow will never be the best athlete on the field, he might not even be in the top five. But rugby, he could dominate rugby. He could be the greatest American rugby player ever.  
For Tebow to remain culturally relevent on the scale that he is now he can't become another Danny Wuerffel or Gino Torretta. If he does, his message is weakened and people will lose faith. He is supposed to be ""The Greatest (something, I really don't know what, but I do know it's not QB)"". He will not reach his full athletic potential playing in the NFL. He will not maximize his impact on society by playing in the NFL.  
He should start learning the game of Rugby today and, after his rookie NFL contract expires, start dominating it.",sports

How do I train my roommate's cats??,"So I have two roommates, and each has a relatively new, relatively young cat (each a little over a year old, I would guess). I grew up with dogs, but I generally love all animals. These cats, however, are evil.

The office has grown in leaps and bounds over the past few years and they now boast a staff roster of over 100 talented members working on a few “AAA” titles at once. The other big thing this year is that this is the first anniversary where id Software is no longer a privately owned entity since the buyout by Zenimax.

"My girlfriend is sleeping with another guy, is it my fault?","My girlfriend and I have a really strong relationship (as in we tell each other everything).  We've been together 9 months. One night were were watching porn to set the mood.  The guy in the vid had a huge penis.  I'm about average, maybe a little below average compared to the tapes we watch, and anyway I jokingly said if she wanted to do something like that we could arrange it.  I was kind of joking but she had mentioned a few times that she wouldn't mind if I was an inch or so bigger.  Remember we tell each other every thing so this stuff comes up often. 

Fast forward a few months later to new years eve.  We were at a friends house party and everyone was getting pretty lit.  A few of the local college basketball players were there too, so naturally the girls were acting super trampy which was pretty sexy.  Making out w/ each other etc.  My GF even made out w/ another girl sometime after the new years kiss.

So it's around 2am and I'm ready to go and start trying to find her.  I get to one bedroom and do a quick peek in. At first I didn't believe it so I stepped all the one into the room.  There was my girlfriend still wearing her shirt while one of those basketball player douche bags was thrusting her.  I thought she might be getting raped so I stepped to him and she's like ""no no it's ok dave don't make him stop"" or something like that.  Then this asshole had the nerve to tell me to shut the door.  I glanced down to see a fairly massive penis thrusting my girlfriend again.  He wasn't wearing a condom.  I was feeling empty.

So I sat outside the room listening in shock almost crying as my gf got fucked for a few more minutes.  On the cab ride home she explained that she thought it was my fantasy.  And I guess since we talked about it I really have no right to be mad.

Fast forward to present.  I've caught my girlfriend having sex with this guy around 6 more times.  One time they even started while I was in the room and tried to get me to watch the whole thing.  I don't even know what to say anymore.  I told her that it was weird and she was like ""sometimes fantasy makes us feel uncomfortable.""

I alrdy told her it was ok so I would be a hypocrite if I made her stop now.  I also told the dude to kindly not come over anymore and he pretty much said that he would come over if she invited him.  

My question I guess is: How do I handle this?  I want my GF to be happy and it hurts me to know I can't satisfy her sexually like this guy can.  On the other hand, she should want me to be happy also right?  Am I an asshole for saying it's ok for her to have sex with a larger male, and then change my mind?

- Flushing? Fuck that shit; you turn on the water to wash your hands and micturition and absolution follow it down the drain.
- Adding to that, you can totally just fucking stand there with your cock dangling and brush your teeth, comb your hair; you can pretty much tend to just about any bathroom activity whilst your system happily dispenses itself into the sink.
- Ever see the posts discussing how to piss in a toilet? Some don't like to hit the water because of the sound it makes. The sink solves all of this man's problems!

And I can't find a single negative about the whole thing; I imagine the water is processed just like that from sewage lines, so there's absolutely no downside to this wonderful system. Adopt today!",DoesAnybodyElse

How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?

I figured for the woodchuck question I would give him the response of:

If a woodchuck could chuck wood, he would and should chuck wood. But if woodchucks can't chuck wood, they shouldn't and wouldn't chuck wood. Though were I a woodchuck, and I chucked wood, I would chuck wood with the best woodchucks that chucked wood.

We should not have unenforceable laws.,"I just got through reading  and it made me think how stupid it is to try to outlaw abortions.  People are just going to go farther and farther out of the way to get what they ""need"", even if every fiber of their being tells them not to.

So my thought is, laws should come with a review date.  If they haven't improved the country by that time, they should automatically be stricken from the books.

Drug laws are a great example.  They kill people in many ways.  There are deaths by police and deaths of police.  There are deaths to cover up the drug trade.  And then there are deaths because underground chemistry is unreliable.  But the drugs are still selling.

If they want to mandate motorcycle helmets, they could try it for a year, but if they can't show a significant improvement in safety, the law would go away on its own.

Couldn't there be a constitutional amendment to put this into all new laws?  The supreme court would have to become involved sometimes to determine if the reviews had actually proven the law to be effective.

"[0] Fuck college dorms, man.","So, yesterday, I woke up to find that my external hard drive with many important (non-backed-up) files on it decided to just stop powering up.  Strike 1 for Sunday.

Then, what do I decide to do after this (and after my roommate had left)?  Smoke a nice bowl, of course.  So I put a towel at the bottom of the bathroom door (it's a dorm, so the bathroom connects to my room and my suitemates' room) and the main door, opened the window, put the fan on, and smoked by the window, the fan blowing the smoke outside, using a spoof made of FRESH dryer sheets and a Mountain Dew bottle.

Here's where things start going wrong.  #1, I realize (too late, of course) that I can't find the Febreze anywhere.  I say, whatever, fuck it, not a big deal, I can't smell anything.  #2, it turns out I'd also forgotten about the mandatory floor meeting, which happened to begin ten minutes after I sparked up.

Ten minutes after the meeting starts, I get a knock on my door.  It's the RAs, investigating a smell of marijuana coming from the room.  Fuck.

I don't have much of a choice (they have a key and are allowed to enter a room if there is reasonable suspicion and there is no answer), so I took the towel out from under the entrance door and opened it.  Of course, I'd forgotten about the towel under the bathroom door, the fan, and the fact that the window was open.

So they explain everything to me, I try to bullshit my way out of it a little, but give up once they start searching the room.  They find and confiscate 4 bottles of Heineken in my fridge, and finally they tell me to open my desk drawer.

Now I'm nervous - I have a bowl, a grinder, a spoof, and about a gram of REALLY good shit left inside the drawer.  So I try to open it juuust enough so they can't see anything ... 

... and it *kinda* worked.  As in, they didn't find the spoof, bowl, or grinder, but they did find the gram.  And confiscated it.

So, trees, smoke a bowl for me - I won't be able to for a while.

Chemistry vs Physical Type vs Social Type...what matters more?,"24 yr old female here.


I'm seeing a guy I adore.  We work so well together it's unbelievable. We are great in bed together, we are great at communicating with each other, we're really good together in general.


But there's a concern I have that ultimately lies in how shallow I am.  I don't think I'm overly shallow but in considering this, I recognize that it is a shallow thing.  I recognize it, but it doesn't bother me now...what I'm concerned about is whether it may bother me in the future.


The Issues:

-I'm not overly attracted to his body type (beautiful as all body types are),  but I am highly sexually attracted to him because I adore the way he is with me.  Due to past experience, the more I fall for someone, the less I recognize that I might not have found them attractive (he is not unattractive, just maybe not my type) passing them by on the street.


-His social habits are almost opposite of mine. I have a very wide social circle and am a total butterfly, he has a close knit group of friends. I love going out and meeting new people for no reason at all, he never feels the need to put himself out with new people and usually turns down an invite to do so.


How much do you think this has the potential of bothering me?  I've been in my share of relationships and just want to be fair to both him and me.  I am able to recognize that this is something that concerns me but it doesn't change at the moment that I want to be with him...but will it in the future?

What is your take on automobile insurance?,"My brother and I got in an argument last night over dinner about automobile insurance; he thinks it should be voluntary and practices this belief by not insuring his vehicles at all.  

His explanation is that insurance is an excessive mandatory expense designed to keep the ""little guy"" down.  He think that insurance companies are part of a systemic problem in which private companies and public policy intertwine.  Also he labels it as another excuse to impose fines on citizens who don't carry it.

I think that liability insurance should be mandatory (as it currently is), since you are effectively piloting a deadly weapon at high velocity towards other people, and most individuals don't have the means to pay for the cost of accidents in which people are injured.

My final statement was that people who have **enough income** to insure their vehicles and **willfully refuse to insure their vehicles** are not only breaking the law, they are ass holes.  They put other other people in financial jeopardy and push up rates on uninsured and under-insured motorist coverage for everyone who *does* pay for insurance.

How do you pick your best man! My best friend pick a friend i introduced him to several years ago...feeling crappy,"So today I found out that my best friend of 16 years has picked my other best friend of 20 years to be his best man. I was blown away by this and only found out when he sent everyone a link to his wedding website. They have done more activities together the past couple of years but at no point did i ever think there was a question that i would be his best man.

I am wondering what the process for picking a best man is. I need to understand!

Does the family have input?

Does the future wife have input? (she favors him)

has anyone else been in this situation?

Right now i feel like was was just dump by my best friend via a website! not sure how to hang out with these guys with out feeling a little betrayed.

I think i need to re-watch ""I love you man""",reddit.com

"Could someone clarify the whole ""Google Voice"" situation for me?","From what I understand after searching around a bit, Google Voice can be used instead of your normal cell phone number to make/receive calls as well as text and check voicemail. It seems like the big deal is that it allows for VoIP-like calling on phones, using data instead of minutes. I've also read about using it for free texting as well. Seeing as I'm in the market for a new phone, I know it's going to be an Android device but I figured I should decide whether I'll hand out a new phone number or a Google Voice number (and apparently I can keep that number even if my cell number changes?). Can Google Voice also handle multimedia messages or keep track of contacts just like a normal phone, or would I miss out on some functionality by using it instead?

"IAmA Juggler. I'm out of practice, but I used to be quite good, and respected in the community...","... Yes. Community. There's a ""scene"" of technical jugglers, largely on college campuses. They tend to reject the clown stereotype, and the notion of performance. It's more about pushing the limit of what tricks can be done.

And I was a member of that community. I used to know basically every street performer in a major US city, and was technically better than all of them (except one). Same thing with another smaller city that I lived in for a while. I've done a number of performances, but they were technical in nature and I wouldn't want to ""be"" a performer.

But enough about me. Juggling was an amazing hobby for me, as it could be very meditative. I don't do it much anymore, but my brain is still changed as a result of it. Then there's the satisfaction of learning new tricks.  - So yeah. Most of the time, the general public only sees juggling as a performance art, and it is usually presented very dishonestly.",IAmA
I need help deciding on a laptop/desktop,"Okay, here's my problem.  I've been planning on getting a new desktop for a few years.  Finally luck has smiled upon me and I don't have to buy a hot water heater, or an air conditioner etc.  

In December I bought a laptop for my wife.  At the time I felt she'd have the laptop and I'd eventually have my desktop and we'd be a happy family.  But since my replacement/temporary computer is so slow, I've begun to use her laptop by default.  And I've gotten used to it.  Her laptop isn't anything special: duo core, 3g of ram, 250g of hd.  But there's something to be said for being able to use it while laying next to your sleeping wife, or taking it wherever the kids are and being able to be there and still mess around on the computer.  I kind of like it, actually I love it.  So, my budget is about $1k.  I was going to try and get a refurbed desktop (1tb, 8g+ram, i7 processor, 512mb vid card).  Could I get something close to that for a laptop at that price?  Or am I going to be  kicking myself in a few years?  I want this to last me a while.  But I know I'll need to upgrade it to extend it's life.  I can't be dropping a thousand bucks every year for a new computer.

Backstory: I've never really had a state of the art computer, so I'm used to waiting a few years to play games on the PC anyway.  Plus if there's a game I REALLY want to play and it's on multiple platforms I can play it on my 360 (I know all ports aren't the same etc etc). 

Or, should I get my desktop, and use my wife's laptop when she's not on it?  I would probably have to uninstall steam and all my games when I get my own.

What would you guys who have most likely been through this do?  My gut says get the desktop but I've kinda gotten used to being able to playing medieval II in bed :D.

Separate comment karma by insight and comedy.  This will allow people to view the comments they wish to see.,"In the wake of crude comments about a submitter's daughter many people are expressing how they feel out of place in a Reddit that is becoming more self-absorbed and immature.  I was thinking about how Reddit might work to maintain the community that the older members are looking for, as it's clear that the Digg-converts are here to stay, and I came up with the idea of separating karma by insight and comedy value.  Or even separating by pertinence and general.   

The idea is simple: double the karma scoring arrows next to a comment and have one represent the comment's intellectual value and another represent a comments humor value.  This allows a comment to be scored twice and folks who want to view insightful, pertinent comments can sort their comments accordingly, while those looking for a laugh can sort their comments by comedy karma.  People looking for both can leave their comment orientation as it is.

If this were to be implemented it would help people to interact with the community they prefer to be in without excluding the other.

Who knows?  It's a rough, flawed idea in need of some tweaking, but I wanted to provide some food for thought.",ideasfortheadmins

Any good FPS games with really good shooting?,"As a fan of shooters, I have noticed a few things. There are different types of FPS games depending on what they focus on. Some games like Half-Life involve great set pieces and wowing the player with a lot of action, great story and an immersive atmosphere. Others such as Fallout 3 focus on more role-playing style gameplay. While both of these games are amazing, the kind of shooter I find myself enjoying the most are the ones that focus just on the shooting gameplay.

Ever since I got Killzone 2 about a year ago, I've found other FPS games a lot less fun. What does it for me is how the movement and shooting *feels.* The movement feels very weighty and takes momentum into account, the aiming also takes into account the weight of the gun you are holding. The shooting feels better than any other game, with the recoil making you aim each shot before pulling the trigger (unlike in Call of Duty where you can aim while shooting.) The way explosions shake the screen, and muzzle flash lights up a room also help with the immersion.

So what I want to know is, what other games out there have really good shooting gameplay? Games where the movement and aiming don't feel so *arcadey* like in Call of Duty?'

A question about (very) moldy weed.,"A friend of mine has a jar full of moldy weed. Please do not berate him for being negligent - his explanation is fair and his heart is true. In any case, he wants to look to the future. And by that, I mean he wants to use this weed to make pot pastries.

Now, the weed is really moldy. It has been sitting in the same jar for about three months now. The weed's brownish in color, the white mold is clearly visible, and the odor of ammonia is strong. Unfortunately, there's quite a bit of this weed, and he really doesn't want it to go to waste - if he is to throw it out, he wants very specific reasons for doing so. His questions to reddit are as follows:

* What type of mold is this/what type of mold commonly afflicts weed?
* There are probably spores - when he opens the jar, do they become airborne? What happens when they are inhaled?
* Does the mold die when it's exposed to high temperatures (being boiled in butter, for example)? Do the spores die too? 
* What happens when a human ingests butter made with this mold/spores, dead or alive? 
* Should he dry it out at a low temperature to kill off the mold first? Is that going to make the spores (more) airborne?
* When the mold feeds on the weed, does it destroy the THC? If it's really moldy but still structurally intact for the most part, is there enough THC in there to make this worthwhile?
* Would it be better to use alcohol to bind the THC first? Can he then boil away the alcohol and get oil, which he can then boil in butter? Would this convoluted method work at all?

Any and all help in this matter will be greatly appreciated. This is kind of a trivial matter, I know, but I really don't want him to poison himself out of sheer stubbornness.

AMA,"I had never run a marathon (or more than 13 miles) before the ironman, and most people seem to think doing 26.2 after some swimming and biking is nuts.  I'm physically average (180lbs, 5'9"", ~18% body fat) and don't particularly like running or swimming.  I decided to try the funky shoes and trained in them for ~8 months before the race last June.  I had a very fun time, though the last six miles were very slow.  I'd be happy to answer any questions about the race, training, running in the five fingers (inspired by recent posts in science), or anything related.

I just want to say thanks.,"I wanted to say how much I appreciate you guys and this small group. I honestly wouldn't feel comfortable approaching the people I'm close to IRL about this problem and having a group of people to share difficulties with has really helped me make improvements in my life.

I'm not there yet, I have a lot I need to work on, but I'm actually working towards ridding myself of a damaging habit. That's huge. I think fighting an addiction feels like you're in a battle that you have to fight on your own, but knowing you're not alone, knowing there are other people struggling against the same problems makes it so it doesn't seem insurmountable. Reading some of the things people have posted my jaw has dropped and I've thought to myself, ""That's me!"" Even just reading the short things you've said is a help. Just coming here to read a few simple lines or post a short comment has helped me resist looking at porn several times. 

To everyone here, and especially those that have been offering advice and keeping this subreddit alive, I want to offer you my sincere thanks. :)",pornfree
DAE wear a jacket with lots of pockets because it is socially unacceptable for them to carry a purse?,"I wear a jacket, when the weather permits, because I like having a lot of stuff with me. I would carry a purse, but being male that would do nothing but attract unneeded attention. I have also worn cargo pants for years and don't plan to every change this. I carry almost everything I can think of and everything I might need. Napkins, writing implements, a whistle, even a computer (it fits perfectly in my cargo pants larger side pockets). The only other way I could see carrying all this stuff and not being inconvenienced would be with a computer bag, but I don't trust those as much as I do my jacket and pants due to how much more difficult it is to take these articles of clothing from me if I am currently wearing them.

"In a recent thread, someone mentioned a ridiculous fact about the size of our sun compared to the entire Milky Way... it was actually wrong.","In fact, if the Milky Way were reduced to the size of the continental United States, our sun would be 7 micrometers in radius, The size of a *white blood cell*, not a period as the original poster said.

"After spending time talking with Muslim apologists on YouTube, I'm starting to genuinely hate Islam.","I know it's not the ""done"" thing to be openly hostile towards Islam, that at some point our culture decided that the best way to deal with an ideology that is diametrically opposed to our notions of freedom of speech, life and liberty was to never say anything to it that may be mildly upsetting. But I've found Muslim apologists to be on the whole far more obnoxious, illogical and hateful than their Christian counterparts. Perhaps a lifetime of hearing the same diatribe of nonsense from Christians has immunised me to it, and to hear Islam is like learning to deal with a pain in your left leg only for the pain to appear in your right. Sure it's the same pain except in a different place, but it's still a pain in the ass you don't want to have to deal with. They are overtly dismissive and unresponsive to criticism. They outright declare any forms of deviancy from expected ideas of Islamic thinking as automatically invalid. The advocacy of the prospect of Islam conquering the world and Muslim's becoming the Master Race both disturbs me and makes me enraged to my very core. 

Acceptance is one thing but when a group of people is actively making it clear that they are rubbing their hands in glee at the real-life prospect of complete control over their fellow human beings, well that ticks me off a little bit. I can throw away concepts like Evangelicals waiting for the Rapture because I know it's nonsense. But when someone talks about having direct control over the world like some kind of gaggle of Bond-villains, all the while practically wallowing in their own sense of superiority, even the most open-parts of my mind want to shut themselves off faster than an Anderson shelter in an air-raid. Nothing in Islam is appealing to me, the Quran is filled with contracted rants about the glory of Allah and the sub-human nature of non-believers. I don't want to hate this religion, I realise that there is cultural and historical significance in the expansive Islamic culture. But as it stands every Muslim I have spoken to has made me despise Islam more and more until I'm now at a point where I can no longer contain my anger at their practices and thoughts.

So does this have a point? Not really, I suppose most of you will be vicious and thorough in your demolition of my position. Such is par for the course on this website. But I just wanted to put it out there for you all to comment on; I hate Islam, and it's Muslims who are to blame. Not through terrorism or anything like that, just by making their religious faith seem like a cancer of the mind.

EDIT: I'll clarify that I do have a number of Islamic friends. The anonymity of the Internet therefore gives me something of a condensed, Islamic-based presentation of these people I encounter. So if I'm raging against anything it's the part of these people that could be considered Islamic. I'm not saying ""All Muslims are assholes"", I'm primarily against the Islamic mindset.",atheism

Advice: Go for it.  You miss 100% of the shots you never take.,"/r/relationship_advice is swamped with comments from geeks who are afraid of doing the wrong thing, of potentially making a mistake, or of getting rejected.

Instead of trying to avoid the rain and thus staying home, go out and live life and know that sometimes it rains out, and if it does rain, so what?  Eventually it stops.

So go ahead and ask that girl out.  Say hi to that cute barista.  Tell your boyfriend you want to do something kinky.  The worst they can do is say ""no.""  The alternative is years later saying ""if only I'd done X.""

Now get off Reddit, go make the move, and tell us how it worked out.

Why I'm not dead yet: my confessions,"I'm just 26 but still I've seen quite a lot of persons who chose suicide. I even saw people who chose to deliberately get into an accident with a truck, making sure they will die in the accident. Maybe I refused to admit it, but all those years of emotional abuse, during my childhood created psychological trauma. I grew up as if I didn't exist and I did fell like a ghost sometimes. I'm not posting here to complain about my past or anything, I just hope I will be able to encourage people. I had countless moments where I fell it would be easier to just give up and die. When I was 20, I just wanted to be ""normal"", I tried therapy and I read theory as if knowing the theory would be enough to heal myself. Then, I became comfortably numb again for more than 5 years. I refused to try anything that could improve my situation because I was tired of all my past failure. I switched from one college degree to another for too long and then, I ended up in graphic design simply because I was too tired to do anything else and I couldn't even believe I could do something involving anything more than this. Then, last year I saw a glimmer of hope because I finally realized I was able to help people through volunteer work (suicide hotline). All my hopes were bases on the assumption that I would start a bachelor degree in social work but then, I failed again and I ended up looking for jobs. I had a series of failures while I was looking for a new job too. I worked for one weeks then I was told I had a lack of self confidence and things would have to change if I wanted to keep that job. I just told them I wanted to leave because I thought I couldn't fit in there and anyway, I wouldn't want to stay in an office job. They agreed and I got back on unemployment insurance but I just fell like a total retard trying desperately to do something good of his life. I was so desperate that I can't remember how often I thought of suicide. There was just one thing keeping me alive, I wanted to go all the way through the end of my suffering and I wanted sweet revenge on those who caused emotionals abuse when I was young. Those things are still the main driving force pushing me and allowing me to believe I can still try something even if I sent countless number of curriculum vitae with no answer and those few times, I got an interview, I didn't receive any positive feedback. I also had a discussion with my mother and I just found out she had to go through the same suffering 16 years ago.

"This morning, the State of New York asked me to serve as a juror for the trial of a man accused of several non-violent drug possession charges. In an attempt to be honest, I told the court why that might be a bad idea ...","So I was summoned for jury duty this morning, and when the lot of us got into the courtroom, the charges against the defendant were read, and, while complicated and filled with legalese, amounted to several drug possession charges. No robbery, no assault, no violence, no intent to sell (as far as I could tell). 

Generally, I have no aversion to jury duty - I served as a juror in a weapons possession trial several years ago, and found it quite interesting, if not tedious at times. Being an engineer, I relished the chance to apply my analytical abilities to a non-technical problem. But when I heard the charges read in this case, I knew I could not in good conscience ever vote to convict this defendant. 

See, I'm one of those folks who opposes the War on Drugs. I see it not as an attempt to limit the use of dangerous substances, but rather an attempt to jail as many poor people as possible while employing as many law enforcement personnel as possible. Taking a cue from the writing staff of The Wire (see this article:  ), I decided a couple of years ago that I would never vote to convict a defendant of non-violent drug-related charges if asked to serve on such a jury. 

When the court read the charges today, I wondered: Would the prosecutor even think to ask if I had moral objections to drug laws? I doubted it. Eventually, the judge said that anyone who had issues that might impede them from being an impartial juror in the case (like knowing the defendant, for example) should approach the bench and explain their issue. So I did. I politely told the judge that I felt the War on Drugs as carried out in America is morally wrong, and that I had vowed some time ago to engage in jury nullification if asked to serve on a jury for a trial involving only non-violent drug possession charges. The judge smiled, thanked me for my honesty, and excused me. 

Could I have had a greater impact by hiding my beliefs, getting on the jury, and hanging it (or convincing the jury to acquit)? Probably. But that seemed really dishonest to me; the court wanted impartial jurors, and I clearly didn't fit that bill in this case. Will the defendant be convicted anyway? Maybe. But I won't have played an active role in doing so, and that's what matters most to me.

I'm sure some will think otherwise, but I'm not posting this because I want some silly, meaningless recognition from the denizens of my favorite news aggregation site. Rather, I simply want other Redditors who feel the same way I do about the drug war to know that this avenue of protest (if you could call it that) is open to them. I was not arrested, intimidated, or scorned in any way. I was not accused of shirking my civic duty, nor cajoled to reconsider. I genuinely felt that my opinion was respected. That being said, hopefully someday I'll get to serve on a jury again, when the defendant is accused of a genuine crime.

EDIT: Thanks for all the insightful replies. It's clear to me now that I should have stuck around for voir dire, if only to get the chance to air my opinion in front of the entire jury pool in the hopes of tainting it. (*creates new file in mental Life Lesson directory*)

EDIT2: Just to be clear, I was never on the jury. I was in a pool of about 150 potential jurors for a case needing 12 (+ 2 alternates). During selection, randomly drawn groups of 14 people are questioned by the attorneys, who can object to any potential juror for any reason (except race / ethnicity, etc.), stated or otherwise. Once enough jurors have been seated, selection ends, and the other potential jurors are dismissed. Therefore, not every potential juror is questioned.",politics

"Fellow Redditors, how do I tell my parents I am leaving the Mormon church?","I am an 18 year old (currently) Mormon male attending BYU, and I don't believe it's true any more. Looking at everything through a non-biased viewpoint, it's hard to believe I lasted this long in this sea of nonsense. And here comes the hard part. I somehow have to tell my hardcore, lifelong Mormon parents. I called my mom today, and she told me how excited she was that my mission was coming up, and how she hoped I would go to Germany, where her mom was from, and all the preparations we would go through, and how proud she was, and I almost started crying. Hopefully sometime this month she'll be coming up to visit me, but I don't know what I'm gonna do then.

Apparently, her imagination got the better of her and she just called me begging to know what it was. I just did it. Hardest thing I've ever done. My hands are still shaking.

"I was kidnapped in Thailand on 01/01/2010, AMA.","At the Full Moon Party in Ko Phangan I was clubbed on the head and taken by Ferry to the mainland where I was driven south towards Hat Yai.

I lost my short term memory from that evening and from the previous 4 days but have managed to recover certain parts of it.

The last memory I had was half waking up in a fan and not being able to move my arms. Scarring on my wrist makes me think they were bound.

The next memory was running through dense forest. The memory is very sparse but after the running it was walking for several hours along the main road. I had only a pair of footy shorts on.

Once in Hat Yai I focused on getting some food and some clothes and through the good will of local Thai people I was able to get 100 baht (3 AUD) to buy some food to eat. I then began walking to the airport where I could speak to someone who spoke some English. I was very dazed and confused and this seemed like the best option.

I ended up going to the tourist police station who then contacted my hotel. The hotel manager was friends with the chief of police who pulled some strings to have me shipped back to Samui.

I got back to my hotel on the 3rd of Jan wearing some clothes for someone half my age with a scar on my wrist and on my knuckle.

Edit:

This is my path of travel. Pink is where I left and walked\ran to a main road and hitched a ride.

"MAPS Conference in April, Sasha and Ann Shulgin will be there.  Details within.","Subj: Psychedelic Science Conference, April 15-18, 2010

Greetings,

The following message comes from Rick Doblin, Ph.D., NORML Board Member
and Founder and Executive Director of the Multidisciplinary Association
for Psychedelic Studies (www.maps.org)

Dear NORML Members and Friends,

I would like to invite you to attend Psychedelic Science in the 21st
Century, (www.maps.org/conference), April 15-18, 2010, in San Jose,
California, with a $50 discount for NORML supporters. This is the largest
conference dedicated to psychedelics to take place in the U.S. in 17
years. The conference will feature presenters from around the world.
Ironically, there is a global renaissance in psychedelic research while
medical marijuana research is still being blocked.  (www.maps.org/mmj/)

Among dozens of world renowned presenters are:
-Stanislav Grof, M.D., co-founder of transpersonal psychology
-Ralph Metzner, Ph.D., consciousness researcher &amp; student of Timothy Leary
and Ram Dass
-David Nichols, Ph.D., medicinal chemist and pharmacologist, LSD
researcher
-Franz Vollenweider, M.D., Swiss neuroscientist
-Alex and Allyson Grey, visionary artists
-Earth and Fire Erowid, Founders of erowid.org, the greatest online
resource about psychoactive substances
-Michael Mithoefer, M.D., psychiatrist who conducted MAPS’ MDMA/PTSD study

One of the most exciting parts of the event will be a banquet to honor
psychedelic luminaries, the godfather and godmother of MDMA, authors of
TIHKAL and PIHKAL, Sasha and Ann Shulgin. Tickets for the benefit dinner
are limited and are likely to sell out.

The conference is scheduled to take place simultaneously with the Patients
Out of Time medical marijuana conference in Rhode Island.  Integrative
medicine proponent Andrew Weil, M.D. will speak by video link to both
events.

I hope that you will join all of the amazing people attending the event.
Medical doctors, psychologists, and other healthcare professionals can
earn continuing education credits at the conference.

For more information or to register, visit www.maps.org/conference or call
MAPS at (831) 429-MDMA (6362).  There is a $50 discount on the

I just learned this in my General Relativity class and I thought I'd share.,"Sometimes when I'm sitting on a plane I think about this.  The closer you are to a gravitational object, the more highly time is dilated (if youre near a black hole, youre time slows down a LOT) So being high up, time should run slower for someone on the ground.  But you are also moving at around 500 miles per hours, so special relativity says time should slow down in the plane.  So which effect wins?  Does time slow down more than a person standing on the earth because of your velocity? or does time speed up in the plane because of their proximity to the surface of the earth?

I finally found the answer, which is as follows.  The way you can calculate the effect of gravity to first approximation is to just consider an inertial frame on the airplane and let it fall.  Due to the equivalence principle, this is the same as letting starting a person at rest and accelerating them away from you and then a second observer accelerates past you (the guy on the ground as you fall).  YOu can calculate the speed when that person gets next to the 'falling' inertial observer by 1/2mv^2 = mgh and solving for v.  You get about 1000 miles per hour, double the horizontal velocity, so the gravitational effect is twice as strong as the special relativity effect.  

So in some respect, if you are standing on something higher up than someone else, you are traveling 'faster' than they are, even though both of you are standing still, because youre both in an accelerated frame of reference.",science

My GF of two years just broke up with me.,"I don't really know what to do.  I can't talk to any of our friends.  I have been super depressed and despondent for a long time.  I never cry really but now I can't stop.  There doesn't seem to be any happy outcome.  All I can do to keep from sobbing is think about how I'm going to get her back.  I wanted to marry her.  I've never been in a relationship nearly this serious before.  All I can think of to win her back is to exercise and get really fit because she say's she doesn't find me attractive anymore...  What's worse is that she is already trying to move on with some guy she is chatting with online.  He lives far away but the thought still hurts a lot. 

I don't even know if I want her back now.

I have health problems that have been plaguing me for years too.  I'm pretty much constantly in pain.  

Since, for the past two years I've been dating her I have pulled away from friends and now I'm completely isolated.  

Edit: Thanks to all of you and your advice.  I forgot to mention that I live with her but she is watching her sisters house for a couple weeks.  

I am doing the exact opposite of what the general consensus is.  I'm planning a large valentines gift to try and get her back.  I'm also not been eating much and doing exercise...

Did Stephen King predict the success of Avatar and the destruction of Haiti in one of his novels?,"I'm in the middle of reading King's *Dreamcatcher* and I come across this sentence: ""Not just any movie either, but the sort of James Cameron extravaganza where the catering costs alone would amount to enough to feed the people of Haiti for two years.""

Just got this email from Google...Thought I'd Share,"Dear Google Apps admin,​

In order to continue to improve our products and deliver more sophisticated features and performance, we are harnessing some of the latest improvements in web browser technology.  This includes faster JavaScript processing and new standards like HTML5.  As a result, over the course of 2010, we will be phasing out support for Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 as well as other older browsers that are not supported by their own manufacturers.

We plan to begin phasing out support of these older browsers on the Google Docs suite and the Google Sites editor on March 1, 2010.  After that point, certain functionality within these applications may have higher latency and may not work correctly in these older browsers. Later in 2010, we will start to phase out support for these browsers for Google Mail and Google Calendar.

Google Apps will continue to support Internet Explorer 7.0 and above, Firefox 3.0 and above, Google Chrome 4.0 and above, and Safari 3.0 and above.

Starting this week, users on these older browsers will see a message in Google Docs and the Google Sites editor explaining this change and asking them to upgrade their browser.  We will also alert you again closer to March 1 to remind you of this change.

In 2009, the Google Apps team delivered more than 100 improvements to enhance your product experience.  We are aiming to beat that in 2010 and continue to deliver the best and most innovative collaboration products for businesses.

Thank you for your continued support!

Sincerely,

Something I just noticed after watching Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure,"I love this movie.  Seen it plenty of times since I was maybe five years old.  Yet I never noticed this one thing before tonight:

Throughout the whole movie, Rufus, played by the late great George Carlin, **never** gives his name.  **Ever.**  He never gives it to the audience in his opening dialogue, he never gives it to the three robed future people before they give him the phone booth, and he never gives it to Bill or Ted.

Yet in the parking lot of the Circle K, future-Bill addresses Bill and Ted and says, *""Listen to this dude Rufus. He knows what he's talking about.""*  There is nothing in the course of the movie to explain how Bill came to know Rufus' name!

I really hope I'm not the only one to have missed this before tonight.  In my more geekish moments I've picked apart the time travel aspect of the story, and I feel really stupid for not noticing this glaring problem sooner.",movies
"A really old school project me and some atheist friends made -- You play a super muscular, duke nukem attitude, grenade launcher wielding jesus.","This project was made during my time in the Game Art program at the Art Institute of Pittsburgh. The object of the class was to work with a team of 5 other people, come up with a fake game trailer, and produce it. Looking back on it, the content is straight up awful, it was 1.5 years into a 3 year program, and alot of the content is amateur --- and it was rushed because we had 9 weeks to do it. However, I was feeling nostalgic and thought I'd share this project with Reddit. Maybe it's worth a few laughs.

Anyways the whole purpose was to take biblical mythology and have fun with it. I thought that if all these people make stories about elves and goblins and take their liberties with other mythical creatures, why can't I take Jesus and just turn him into a stylish badass who walks around wreaking righteous carnage on the earth?

About to break off engagement,"Good evening everybody. Just wondering if the hive mind can help me figure out a couple things, or at least just listen. So I'm in my second year of what has seemed like a very good relationship, at least good enough to make me want to marry the girl. We dated for a year and a half before the engagement, it wasn't perfect but we made it work. She came into the relationship with some very heavy baggage (more later if it's justified). I had strong enough feelings for the girl to work through it with her. We moved in together soon after I proposed and have been living together for a little over six months now. Lately everything I do and say becomes an argument. I'm not the type to start fights, and have never really had any issues with anyone in my life before. I try to talk to her about it and it just escalates the situation. 
Cut to last night. She got mad at me for something and I got mad back. It's been twenty-four hours since we even spoke. In this twenty four hours I've had a lot of time to think and am starting to realize I'm not really happy and I haven't been for a long time. We hardly make love, and I'm realizing she never even pursues me for as much as a kiss. We've spoken about our different needs, and I always end up being the bad guy and the pervert. Looking back I'm starting to wonder why I thought everything was so great and it's all kinda hazy. We've got nothing in common. Our music tastes, our religious beliefs or lack thereof ;), our hobbies, what we eat, our political views, our sex drives. Nothing matches. 
My question for you is this.
Should I stick it out and find a way to make it work, or should I cut my losses and leave? What would you do?

tl;dr: Considering breaking off engagement due to bad chemistry, no commonalities. Pros? Cons?

I'll be up for quite a while to answer questions.

2-3pmish - Chicken (breast) + rice and small cut potatoes

Gym -

9pm - Chicken (breast) +one cup rice

Why is everyone assuming Apple’s ban on Flash is supposed to drive traffic to the app store?,"It’s a glib explanation, but it doesn’t make sense to me, and here’s why. Crucial fact:

* **Nothing prevents you from installing web apps on the iPhone without going through the app store.**

The widespread assumption, as I understand it, is that banning Flash forces developers to rewrite their SWFs as iPhone apps, which can then only be distributed on the app store after receiving explicit approval from Apple. Right?

The problem is, that only applies to “native” UIKit apps, because web apps have never been subject to this process of dictatorial control. And an HTML5 web app can do just about anything a Flash app can do (the only exception I know of is recording through the camera and mic, please correct me on this). It will usually do it faster and better, *and* it will install directly to the home screen just like anything from the app store. So if you’re porting a Flash app to the iPhone, you can avoid the approval process and charge whatever you like without giving a single penny to Apple. If you’re so inclined.

Oh, I know, HTML5+JS in WebKit wasn’t *always* as capable as Flash. If you had a Flash app a couple years ago you wanted to port to the iPhone, you might’ve needed UIKit for some things, and you’d have had to submit to Apple’s approval process and distribution scheme. But remember, the app store didn’t even *exist* for the first year after the iPhone was released. Every third-party application was supposed to be a web app running under WebKit (exactly like Google’s vision for Chrome OS, incidentally). Developers were supposed to target open standards like scriptable SVG and &lt;canvas&gt;, not UIKit or Flash.

That vision turned out to be premature, in 2007, because WebKit on iPhone OS 1.0 wasn’t quite up to the task. But now it’s 2010, WebKit and HTML have evolved, and you no longer need UIKit for the kind of animations and interactivity Flash provides. Moreover, on the desktop, the installed base of HTML5-capable browsers is growing. Software written to any device-specific API, including UIKit, is getting less relevant. So for the types of applications that use Flash, as well as many more complex apps, UIKit is already overkill and on the way out—do people think nobody at Apple realizes that?

I’m not saying Apple doesn’t want developers writing for UIKit. The app store is profitable, for one thing, and the number of apps targeting UIKit provides a form of vendor lock-in. But here’s the specific point regarding Flash:

* **Keeping Flash off the iPhone has nothing to do with skimming off profits from the sale of iPhone apps, because you are perfectly free to sell non-Flash apps without going through Apple’s app store.**

I know Reddit as a whole has been suffering from collective retardation on this topic, but does that at least make sense to you folks?

* DRM

I have a goReader... Any ideas on what to do with it? (More info inside),"I have an old goReader. It's basically a primitive tablet PC. (I've looked online for more info on it, and I found one page that supposedly described the product, but it was definitely describing something a little newer than the one I have.) The company has pretty much gone MIA.

But, I want to do *something* with it. I know my ex (who left it at my house a few years ago) used to play a Command and Conquer type game on it. As it stands, I can use it as a reader (I have put a few books on it from projectgutenburg and it is decent for this application...)

I want to see what (if anything) it is useful for. Here are some stats on it that I pulled from the system properties screen: 64mb memory, 1gb external card (""microdrive""?), processor type: Strong ARM, OS: Windows CE version 3.0 (build 126), Allocated storage memory: 32mb (can be bumped up to the full 64).

I have the USB cord for it (one end is USB, the other end is some crazy thing that I have only ever seen on this product).

It has some java builder on it called EVMconsole. I think this was put on there by my ex to make the C&amp;C game work.

It has a **very** responsive touch screen (it uses a stylus and is very accurate.) It would be great as a drawing tablet, but I don't know that the hardware could run *any* decent drawing program.

The same hole that the external card goes in will also (supposedly) hold a wifi card, but I don't have one of those. (This thing is from around 2001, so I don't even think they use the same ones now.) **EDIT:** looking closer, there is a separate slot for the wifi/ethernet card. (I still don't have one, either way.)

It's pretty much brand new. My ex played with it for a few weeks and forgot about it, and when we broke up it ended up staying here. It even still has the plastic cover on the screen!

I realize that it has *WAY* less horse power than my Blackberry, so it's probably worth less than a paperweight, but I figured I'd ask and see if anyone had any ideas on this.

I am pretty good with computers, but sometimes I think I know just enough to fuck something up good and not be able to fix it, so if you have a cool idea to mod it up all crazy, please try and help me understand how to do it right so I don't fuck this up.

I'd like to see if it's useful as a drawing tablet (I'm in school for web design/development), or a portable karaoke machine type thing (it has mic &amp; headphone jacks and built-in speakers), or anything else that would make it worth messing with. (besides the book reader thing... That's pretty cool, I guess).",technology

Not ready yet to make the next step,"So I am a 21 year old male who is in a 11 month relationship with a wonderful girl. I am completely happy with her and I can honestly say that my life has never felt better. However one problem that may have occurred is that she was initially saving herself for marriage but we were having sex after a month of dating. Now I don't know if it is because we had sex but she talks about our future all the time. She talks about what kids we will have, where we will live together, when we should get engaged, and when we should get married, where our wedding will be, who will be invited.... basically all these questions about our future that I don't think about at all. Everytime she asks my opinion about the future, I tell her I don't really think about it and she gets really hurt as she says she feels like she loves more than I do for her.  I really do care about her and these ""arguments"" are the only type of problems we have. 
I could very well see myself marrying her one day but it is not something I think about as it wont be for years but yet I don't know what to say to her without causing problems.

When I asked her why, this is her explanation. 

""They have a faith-based approach.  They really integrate spiritual healing into their practice, you know, like praying and laying hands on a patient.... You know, because we can't ignore the power of spiritual healing and God's power to heal people.... I mean, I want to be a trauma surgeon... sometimes you just have to realize that you can't do everything, and you just have to put it in God's hands... (comment from me about how I can't compartmentalize well and couldn't handle Emergency Medicine)... Well that's why it's good to have that knowledge about what happens to you after you die, so you don't have to worry about them, because they're with God.""

I'm wonder what the best course of action might be concerning my depression at this point.,"*I attempted suicide 6 years ago and have continued life since then, things have been mostly good since then but as of late thoughts have continued to trend downward.  I thought maybe putting a few thoughts on paper might help but I'm not real convinced its a good thing but here are my thoughts on it.*

""The image that comes to my mind most often is being a moth and seeing so many moths flying around a light, they're drawn to it and obsessed with it, but I don't feel drawn in to that light.  So often I don't feel that same wanting and desire.  I don't feel like Im being pulled to keep wanting to be in that light like everyone else seems to.  No one should need a reason to want life, it should be effortless and a given.  Why should I try daily to bargain with myself to stick around?  

All at once it all feels like I could laugh about it, the absurdity of needing nothing but searching for hard for reasons, for things to need.  I shouldn't need reasons I should just be content with being.

I don't feel like I desire any pity or attention from others, very much the opposite.  I've often thought if it happens again that I'd hate to inconvenience anyone, I'm sure it wouldnt be an easy thing for those that know me to deal with to begin with but I would hate to inconvenience them on top of whatever else they'd have to deal with.  

This is no fault of anyone.  This is me and its me alone.  There is no tipping point no last straw, no good reasons to do a stupid thing.  It just is and it continues.  It receeds and inevitably comes back so I wait for it.  In this way I suppose I am a different sort of moth, one that cant seem to stay away from going away from that light. ""

What tends to worry me most is when these ideas come so easily, effortlessly and become normal.  I really don't care to talk to my family about it, I feel its a worry I'd rather not put on them.  I don't know if there's really any solution at this point beyond medication.",needadvice

Another question on Newtonian gravity,"In high school, I learned the Newton's law of gravity.  It said:

But according to Einstein, gravity is not a force at all, but an effect of space time curvature(correct me if I am wrong here).
Also, gravity waves are not faster than light, hence those particles which are farther to earth than where light has reached cannot be attracted by earth.  So, was Newton wrong?",science

Spirituality of a homosexual,"So, I've recently just come out of my self-denial about my homosexuality. After I decided to accept myself and to be pround of who and what I am, I did some research into the history of homosexuality in societies that weren't Eurocentric in viewpoint.

What I found:

Joseph Campbell in the Power of Myth stated that Native Americans revered homosexuals because they believer they were people with two spirits. BAM! This hit me especially hard because it described how I have felt my entire life. When I was in high school I thought I might be a schizophrenic or something like that, but I've always been fully functional, excelling socially, in sports, academically and have had a pretty good life until I realized who I was decided to deny it for a period of time.

I've always been a psychonaut, diving deep into my own spirituality and I'd been running into a wall repeatedly the past year or so because of my self-denial. From what I have read and deduced from my own experiences in life, I believe that I, spiritually, am the unity of a man and a woman. Two in one, if you will.

Is there anyone else that fits this mold out there? Do you think most (or maybe even all?) homosexuals are this way?

"None-the-less, the Stanford Police would like to remind you to be wary of offering rides to people whom you do not know.","A message from STANFORD UNIVERSITY
Message sent - 2/1/2010

In the early morning hours of Saturday, January 30th, a Stanford student struck up a conversation with a stranger at a bar in Palo Alto near the campus.  The stranger, a male, suggested that they go out for food.  The student drove the stranger to a McDonald's in East Palo Alto.  The stranger then asked the student if he could crash at the student's residence. The student refused, so the stranger got out of the student's vehicle.  Unbeknownst to the student, the stranger left a bag of personal items in the student's car.  Upon discovering the bag, the student took it to the Stanford Police (on Monday, February 1) so that it could be returned to the stranger.  Among the items in the bag, the police located a pair of handcuffs and lighter fluid.  The officers were able to ascertain the identity of the stranger and, after some investigation, determined that the individual did not appear to pose a threat to the student or the community.  None-the-less, the Stanford Police would like to remind you to be wary of offering rides to people whom you do not know.

"Dear Reddit user complementing leaving the church,","I am a young man, in the same positions as you. When I was 11 I learned of pornography on the internet: I was ordained the priesthood unworthily. Every day I would say to myself ""I need to stop this"". I thought that the church was true because of personal experiences and miracles that happened in my family. Soon I continued this, passing the sacrament, becoming a teacher and a priest, and even entering the Holy Temple - all unworthily. I had tried to stop my addiction. When I became a priest I tried to dedicate myself to stay away from it. I decided that I needed to pray, and I even decided to read from the Book of Mormon. The next day I am on the computer and I don't commit the sin.  I did this for a week, maybe taking a small peak somewhere. Soon I gave in. I repeated this process and still am. However, I would like to bear my testimony unto you. I know that prayer and scripture study do help to combat the adversary, I know that I have been blessed. And I even know that we have an immortal spirit. I don't know if I can still go on a mission because I have lied to the bishop so many times, but if I can then I know I have a strong testimony. I know that this church is true and I hope that you can humble yourself. I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ amen.",lds
Enough with all these [10]'s,"I am quite tired of seeing people post that they are [10]'s when they are obviously not.

Like what a lot of other people say that would agree with me, if you are a [10] you would be WAAAYYYYYYYY to high to even function a computer.

There should really only be 4 highs on this ""Scale"".....[0] 'sober', [1] 'buzzed', [2] 'pretty high', and [3] 'baked outta your mind'

"i predict the ipad will save the (small) newspaper AND (big) publishing industries, and here's why","i worked in the newspaper business for a decade. newspapers spend a lot of money on two things: newsprint and subscribing to the associated press and other press syndicates. these subscriptions allow them to run nation and world stories and, more importantly, give them access to vast resources such as op-ed columnists, thousands of feature stories, photos from around the world, a gigantic notable people mug shot database, GIS data, comics pages, horoscopes and tv listings.

newspapers have always been printed on paper. these people know no other way. it's painful how awful newspaper web sites can be. i was on the inside. i was an integral part of agonizing discussions on what we were willing to put on our web site, how much time and energy and money we were willing to devote to it.  after everything was done and said, it was going to have to be free content. we all knew it, and to fool ourselves into thinking people were going to pay to surf to our web site and read the news was just silly. 

even the new york times, which has had a pretty nice web site -- easily navigable, freely available content except for their columnists -- is now going to charge for most everything. and yet they know it's not going to work.

meanwhile, hundreds of magazines have shuttered their doors in the last couple of decades. people can't afford books these days, and publishers have long cast their fates with only tried-and-true money making authors. all this because printing books and fancy four-color magazines is an expensive enterprise.

besides being a journalist, i'm an avid reader. i have read e-books on my palm pilot and it's not much fun. i've looked at a kindle and i wasn't so impressed. the technology is lacking somehow. it's too ethereal to pinpoint what the disconnect is, though.

besides being a journalist, *and* an avid reader, i'm also a mac person. i like the way apple does things so intuitively. i hate arguing with pc people about why i love macs, just suffice it to say that it's way, way easier to teach an old person or someone who is resistant to the whole concept of computers how to use a mac than a pc. it's just the way it is.

what i've seen of the ipad impresses me a lot. 

i really want to read books on it. i'd eagerly pony up as much as five bucks to read a book on an ipad, rather than at least eight bucks for a paperback book or twenty plus dollars for a hardback, or being pressured to read a book from the library in a week or two after having to wait to even get my hands on it. 

i want to read newspapers on it too. and i'd be willing to pay the local newspaper as much as i am now for the print edition to read high quality content on an ipad. with one important caveat: the content be free of all advertising and just be local and state news. i can catch cnn on the teevee or online for the rest. i don't think i'd be willing to pay the new york times for their content, but i'm sure other people would be more than happy to fork over the cash.  

i think i'd like to read a magazine on the ipad too. and a few other specialized publications. 

newspapers in small and medium-sized markets fill a void. there's no real place for a town that doesn't have a tv station to get the local news. not on the internet, except for the local paper's web site. large-market newspapers no longer provide a timely product. it's too hard to compete with news stations that are affiliated with larger and more monied news conglomerates that provide the product almost instantaneously. they can't continue to provide a product with stale content monday through saturday, and then a feature heavy edition on sunday using an antiquated technology that costs a ton of money.

there will be knock-offs of the ipad but, as usual, apple's blazing a trail ... in the world of *reading* this time.",reddit.com

I suppose my question is- what's next? Do I patent the idea? It seems like patents are ridiculously expensive to get, and I don't know exactly what's required for doing so. After patenting it, would it be easier/more profitable to sell the idea to someone who can easily produce it, or try and market/produce it myself with a business partner?

See inside...","So last week I made a PayPal transaction that cost $18 with only $6 dollars in my bank account (I have two bank accounts one with BOA and the other is with RaboBank.  RaboBank is my Primary as I am living in the Netherlands.)  Anyways this left my account negative 12 dollars.  So they charged the $35 overdraft fee which would be expected - and hey it was my mistake so I was happy to own up to it.  But then PayPal decided to charge two separate transactions totaling 33 cents.  Well the account being negative now $47.00, one transaction for $0.25 and the other for $0.08 added another two $35 overdraft fees now bringing my total negative balance to $117.  But wait, apparently in June BOA decided to enact a new overdraft fee called an ""Extended Overdrawn Balance Charge"" which is another $35 fee in which isn't caused because of a transaction posting but rather when the account is overdrawn more then 5 days.  So this brought my total account balance to negative $152.00 for going less then 13 dollars in the red.  This to me seemed not only outrageous but morally wrong (ever heard of usury?) 

So I made the long distance call from the Netherlands to BOA's 800 number and after a short hold was on the phone with a nice young lady who immediately advised after I mentioned what I was calling about that there is nothing she can do and could pass me to a supervisor - so I say ok no problem.  The supervisor gets on the phone with a very cold and uncaring attitude and gives me the same speech on how there is nothing they can do to return fees but I could request a call back from someone higher up which could take 24 to 48 hours.  I argue with her for about 5 minutes before realizing that they really could give a shit.  

Now I am pissed.  Not because I don't have money and cant afford the insane fees, but rather its become about principal.  So I get on the Google and start searching around forum posts to which I see tons of other people in way worse situations complaining about their customer service and the way that the BOA generally mistreats their customers.  While reading through a woman's tragic tale of misfortune and some $1000 in racked up bank fees she posted this Gem **1-704-386-5687**  This number is to BOA executive support.  I called them, told them everything that happened and within 5 minutes I had $140 worth of overdraft fees returned - without hassle.  If anyone out there is getting killed by fees and has a legitimate excuse or hardship, this is the number to call, not the 800 number.

I will say one last thing.  I plan on getting back to the US in June for a holiday.  The first thing I plan on doing is closing my BOA account and opening a account at my local credit union.",reddit.com

Dear Reddit: How does one make friends!?,"Dear Reddit,

I just got my first real job ever, it's in San Francisco.  The only problem is that I grew up in NY, went to college in PA, and moved back home to NY after graduation for an internship.  So essentially, I don't know anyone or anything in SF.

I've never had problems making friends, and I have a good group of friends at home and from college.  But this isn't college - I'm going to be busy working!   The job is at a tech startup with only two other guys, who are older, and probably not material that I'd want be making good-buddies-to-go-out-drinking-every-weekend with.

So Reddit, what do you all suggest I do?  

If any of you live in San Francisco and would like to be my friend, let me know!  I'm a 23 year dude, ex-college athlete (wrestling), I love video games, movies, getting drunk, tech-geeky stuff, football, being active, and generally just having a good time.  I'm easy going, I never get into fights with anyone, and I just want to be able to meet people to hang out with.

**tl;dr** I'm moving to a city I've never been to before for a job.  I don't know anyone there, and the people I'll be working with are probably not the best bet for me to be hanging out with on weekends.

How do I go about making friends!?

Who's to blame for the financial collapse?,"Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives have each had their own ideas of who to blame for the financial crisis.  Until tonight I've been on the Democrat's/liberal's side which says that there hasn't been enough regulation of the banking industry.  My understanding of the financial crisis has been that it was a ""perfect storm.""  Banks were handing out NINA(No Income No Assets) loans, selling them to other banks who then chopped them up and repackaged them as mortgage backed securities(MBS) with AAA ratings.  It was only a matter of time before people who had no job and no assets could not repay their mortgages, and it's no surprise then that these types of activities eventually led to a crash.  

Until tonight I thought that these practices were allowed because nobody told banks not to do it, and banks were simply acting in their own(albeit short-term) interest.  But now I think I was wrong.  Fanny Mae and Freddie Mac were both organizations set up by the US government]( to encourage people to purchase homes.  Originally they were strictly a government organization, however eventually they were allowed to be publicly traded companies looking to make a profit, and they were not accountable to the SEC since they still enjoyed the backing of the federal government.  They used their ability to take out low interest loans to buy up mortgages from other banks, making a profit from the difference in interest rates and also by selling MBS.  This provided an incentive for other banks to hand out more mortgages since they could just sell them to Fannie and Freddie(Fannie/Freddie owned 90% of the mortgages on the market).  When people inevitably started defaulting on their loans, Fannie and Freddie [went under]( and the MBS's lost their value.  This caused a cascade of [credit default swap(CDS) payments to be triggered since they had been purchased as a hedge for the MBS's.  AIG supplied the largest share of CDS, and they simply could not pay out.  Banks lost all value of the MBS and the CDS hedge didn't pan out causing the whole financial industry to teeter on the edge of collapse.

So, now I'm wondering how is this not directly the fault of our government for allowing Fannie and Freddie to exist in this way in the first place?  While the lack of regulation and transparent exchange of CDS's is a problem and has gotten a whole lot of attention, it seems like it was far from the underlying problem which was actually handing out all these mortgages in the first place.  And since this is not happening anymore, haven't we by and large removed the systemic risk?  If we have, I'm now wondering how big a deal this whole ""too big to fail"" business really is since they wouldn't have failed if our government hadn't allowed the mortgage bubble to happen in the first place.

Reddit, what are your thoughts on all of this?  There is a lot of anger out there directed at the banking sector, but now I can't help but wonder if it's very unfair to blame them given everything I've mentioned above.",AskReddit

TIL that James Blunt is actually badass,"&gt;In 1999, he served as an armoured reconnaissance officer in the NATO deployment in Kosovo. Initially assigned to reconnaissance of the Macedonia-Yugoslavia border, Blunt and his unit worked ahead of the front lines directing forces and targeting Serb positions for the NATO bombing campaign. He led the first squadron of troops to enter Pristina, and was the first British officer to enter the Kosovo capital. His unit was given the assignment of securing the Pristina airport in advance of the 30,000-strong peacekeeping force; the Russian army had moved in and taken control of the airport before his unit's arrival. As the first officer on the scene, Blunt shared a part in the difficult task of addressing the potentially violent international incident.[11] There were less intense moments during Blunt's Kosovo assignment, however. Blunt had brought along his guitar, strapped to the outside of his tank. At some places, the peacekeepers would share a meal with hospitable locals, and Blunt would perform. It was while on duty there that he wrote the song ""No Bravery"".[12]

Social justice and programming languages,"So I happened to watch an episode from justiceharvard.org]( the other day, an idea strike me, compare justice reasoning to programming languages.

IAmA guy who had a breast removed. The surgery was botched. AMA.,"I noticed several submissions about the increase in breast reduction surgery for men, and noticed that many people mistakenly thought this trend to be a case of ""lazy fatties, just get some effing exercise!"" Male breast growth can have many causes and it affects 30% to 60% of pubescent boys, but usually disappears after a few years.

Me, I was a 6'3"" slightly underweight fellow who developed a single breast (on my left side). This is known as unilateral gynecomastia.

I was in a long term relationship at the time and she said she didn't care, but I still felt like a freakshow. Eventually I saw a doctor, she asked me if I was taking any bodybuilding supplements or eating lots of red meat and when I answered negative to those questions I was told it was a common hormonal imbalance which would resolve itself in a year or so.

Almost three years later nothing had changed, and this time I agreed to surgery. I imagined this would make my chest look normal again.

I'll tell the rest of the story in answer to your questions, but I will list here the things that went wrong during the operation:

* An assistant left the cauterizer resting on my skin. This caused a permanent burn scar above my nipple.
* They took away too much tissue. I now have an indent instead of a boob.
* This also left my nipples at different heights.
* I had to return after 3 months, another 3 months, and another 6 months, to get the wound fluid extracted. Unfortunately it never stopped oozing out, which has caused my skin to stain significantly. 

EDIT: Here's a before and after. Not the greatest quality pictures, but clear enough. Fun party trick: if I flex my 'pecs', a ravine appears diagonally above my nipple and my nipple disappears into it. 

EDIT: I'm expecting a phone interview any second now. Will be back soon.

EDIT: Fun fact. Before this kind of surgery, they first test whether the growth isn't a tumor. One such test was a mammogram. They put your breast between two plates (so that they can use X-rays on it) and tighten it until you've got this pancake spread out before you. It's painful and I felt a bit guilty that this is most often used for women who have breast cancer, whereas I just had a cosmetic issue. They also did an echoscopy.

EDIT: Fun fact. The way they extract the wound fluid is by sticking a syringe in your nipple. The area is too numb to really feel it, but having someone stick a needle in your nipple, poke around a bit, and slurp up one or two syringes full of goo is certainly interesting.",IAmA
Mathematical problem - I need help!,"So i've been thinking of this problem for some time, and need it explained once and for all.

You have a coin that you flip and for the purposes of this example there's a 50% chance it'll land on either side.

Suppose you flip it and 10 times in a row it comes up heads. Amazing! Extremely unlikely and amazing for that reason. However you say to yourself, i built this coin so that it was even, so over time (t-&gt; infinity) I would expect this system to output even results (50% to both sides).

So can I assume as time passes (and slowly approaches infinity) there will be a 'pressure' to enforce this balancing out? I know the end results of an infinite experiment, so suppose i'm half way through (inifinty/2) and i'm still just getting heads. On each individual throw I know that my chances are 50% for each side, but sooner or later for these results to average out i'll need to start getting tails. At that point in time am I any more or less likely to get tails, based on the history of the throw?

The idea of Qualia is a Non sequitur,"I have read many refutations of the idea of qualia but I have yet to read one which mirrors my interpretation. I ask you, the browsers of r/phil to tell me if this argument has already been made or not and point me in the right direction if that is the case. 

&gt;""Qualia"" is an impossibility. You cannot describe a sense in terms of another sense accurately. For example the test of qualia is to ask ""how would you describe the color red to a blind person"" the answer is you cannot. The reason for this is because the idea of the color red is learned through the specific sense of sight, not because it is a separate and unique experience between users.  

&gt;There are specific phenomena which can only occur and be interpreted on specific biological sensors. For humans the only sensor which can detect light around a narrow spectrum called the visible spectrum is the eye. During the formative years people are taught that this particular phenomena is linked to a linguistic counterpart – the spoken word “red” or undoubtedly with “hot” which as it happens is so because the blackbody radiation spectrum of materials over a certain temperature is what we call both red and hot thus categorizing them.

&gt;The idea of a color then is simply its correct categorization, just as all senses are. “Soft” for example cannot be mimicked nor can “loud” accurately in terms of other senses. Asking then how do you describe the color red to a blind man, is a non-sequitur. The material definition of the process is all there is to the process – not being able to translate that to others or to other senses is a result of their specialization and arguably a deficiency of our evolved communication methods.

Mind you I have read arguments which are similar in their simplicity and material basis, but none which make the argument that subjective qualia demands an impossible relationship and is thus based on fallacy.",philosophy
Mad Men watchers: What do you like about this show?,"I feel like this is an odd question because I like Mad Men. I have been catching up with it in the past couple months and I'm about halfway through season 3. This show has won numerous awards for ""Best Drama"", etc.. and most people I talk to who have watched it, LOVE it. 
And although I do like it, I really fail to see where it is a truly EXCELLENT show. I like the directing, I like the costumes, the dialogue, the way they sneak a humorous moment into an awkward or tense situation. But I don't think it is an amazing show. I think the storylines take way too long to develop (if I were watching one episode per week, I think I would have given up by now), they give a little bit of back story on the characters, then drop it completely (Don's past ""marriage"", Peggy's pregnancy, etc...) and there are way too many characters that they are trying to dig deeper into but can't so you're left with a very shallow and incomplete picture of each person. I'm not saying it's a bad show, like I said I keep watching, but please explain to me why it is a GREAT show ...",television

"GameDev, am I wasting my time with Flash?","I had some programming courses in c++, know my way around php,js and html, but the past year I have done most of my programming in AS3. I like it because it has relatively easy vector graphics and input-and-eventhandling, and because I can put it online for people I know (or others) to use/play. You can see some of the things I made here.

But I do want to move on. I want to write bigger programs/games, and maybe collaborate with people over the internet. Now when I read Reddit, it seems that even thinking about Flash is some sort of sign of retardation. It will be replaced, it's generally bad, not open source, all that stuff. But on the internet as a whole Actionscript programming seems pretty popular. And I now have some experience under my belt with it.

Ask Proggit: How do you get your PL/SQL in to version control?,"I work on many client's databases and do a fair bit of Oracle PL/SQL development. One issue I have is keeping PL/SQL code backed up in a consistent way.

Some of my devs will save their packages/procedures to text files and add them to version control on their own. But this gets messy, and it's very tempting to just load the procedures from their IDE and start deving from there. Before you know it your procedures on your drive are out of sync with what's in your schema.

I was hoping there would be a tool that would dump a schema's procedures/package DDL, then auto-add it to subversion. I've built something like this where twice a day I grab all the pl/sql ddl and throw it in a text file to archive. I haven't added it directly to SVN yet, but that's just a matter of a shell script. I was hoping there would be a more standard tool though, since that seems a bit hacky.

Using the database backups has it's drawbacks -- no easy way to diff/restore, etc. Plus you have to deal with the DBA's to even look at a backup, yeck.

Proggit: Do you use a different keyboard layout for programming?,"I´ve always found the German layout better for correspondence and the American one better for programming.

"Reddit, help me out. Am I doing the right thing here?","Okay, so I've been an ectomorph (skinny guy) all my life. I'm six feet tall even, and between the ages of 17 - 22, my weight was consistently around 135 - 140. I was skinny, but on the plus side, I had next to zero body fat.

I'm now 23 and weigh about 172, though I still look pretty skinny, however I suffer from slight moobs as well as hip fat (love-handles).

About a month or so ago, I started running every day (my college has a great indoor track) and I've been lifting weights every other day. Mainly upper-body, mainly free weights just to ensure I don't lose too much muscle in the process of weight loss.

Honestly, and hear me on this, I don't care about being big and buff. So, please don't tell me to focus on gaining muscle rather than losing fat, as that is a very hard thing for someone with my genes to do. Trust me -- I've tried it, and I'm sick of it! I don't care any more. I just want these hips and manboobs gone. That's really all I care about.

I just want to be lean again with minimal body fat. I would have no issue being around 155 lbs. or so.

I don't know my BF%, but I'm guessing it's around 20% or so.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Feel free to ask absolutely any questions. I really want to be lean again this spring and feel comfortable in t-shirts.",Fitness

What would reddit remind an about-to-be-elected a Republican to do?,"It's Primary day in Illinois. I've never been too intensely involved with politics, but today my name is appearing on a ballot.

I'm just curious if anyone has any ideas on what I can do as a young guy coming up in the party to steer Republicans away from being utter and complete douche-nozzles.   

At the end of my term, I'd like to see the phrase ""reddit-Republican"" become a valid sub-culture.   

I know Republicans aren't popular here, but today may be your best chance to influence someone who's entering the fray on that side. What do I need to know/remember to stay true to my redditness?

Hi Hockey Reddit - I'm going on a Hockey Road Trip tomorrow!

Thurs, Feb 4: Vancouver Canucks at Ottawa Senators (NHL)

Fri, Feb 5: Belleville Bulls at Ottawa 67's (OHL)

Sat, Feb 6: Pittsburgh Penguins at Montreal Canadiens (NHL)

"Given all the talk of political corruption and all of the crooks in Washington, are there any politicians you do trust?  Who are they?","There has been a lot of talk on here about the rampant corruption in Washington, and I think we paint with a bit too broad of a brush.  Sure, a lot of politicians are bought and sold by the corporations from which they should be protecting us, but there are still some politicians out there who are truly committed to the belief that they are in Washington to serve the public.  Let's name some of them.  Let's not continue the false notion that everyone in Washington is a crook, because that makes it that much more difficult for the honest ones to do good work.

You don't have to give any justification for your answers.  I just want to see that not all of us have completely given up hope in our system, as broken and flawed as it may be.

I'll start.  I trust Mike Capuano (D-MA).  He was mayor of Somerville, MA when being mayor of Somerville meant working against the corruption and crime of the Winter Hill Gang (Whitey Bulger, et al).  He worked his way up to become an incredible representative, mainly through straight-talk and genuine engagement with his constituents, and would have made a hell of a Senator had the Massachusetts Democrats not decided to choose Martha Coakley as their candidate.  I believe that if Capuano had won that primary, we wouldn't be talking about Scott Brown right now.
