Hello reddit. This is a fake account. Thank you for keeping me alive,"I have an account here. I enjoy the laughs, arguments, being corrected when wrong.

The past years have been devastating to me. I am fairly isolated for numerous reasons. It includes mental health, though for me this has only enhanced questioning. I have to question myself too.

I don't need no friends. It's a good idea for me and for others. But reddit has given me something real till a time I may join the world again. If it doesn't, this place has been something outside my bubble. I have learned and felt a real touch to my thoughts. Thank you.",reddit.com

Hi Reddit. I'm going to graduate from university soon and I need your advice.

My long-term goal is to work in the intelligence community. Whether I get to travel around and kick down doors (I'd love to do that!) or work as a case officer, that's what I want to do.

My shorter-term goals are: to get professional training, have adventures/experiences, give a few years in direct service to my country and preferably work either in the Pentagon or Afghanistan. Hopefully having a rite of passage, getting discipline, etc. Getting to do badass stuff is a bonus.

I have no qualms about enlisting with a college degree, in fact I think I would prefer it to earning a commission (going officer would be a much longer and more uncertain option, at least from what I've seen).

New house came with new cat (possibly pregnant),"Note: i created a reddit account just so i could post this and share with the reddit community. I visit reddit everyday.

I just bought a new house and was moving things in from my car and on one of the last trips to the car a cat came running down the stairs and out of the house. The cat wasn't in there before and most likely slipped in when the door was open when i putting stuff in the house. I didn't think to much about it and left to get more of my stuff. When I got back i started putting boxes in the house and on the 2nd or 3rd trip from the car I went upstairs to my bedroom and found the cat rolling around on my bedroom floor. It was interesting to see the cat there having a good time. She was really friendly and was constantly kneading and purring. I Finished moving my stuff in for the night and she was still in the house. I opened the door to let her out but she wouldn't go out so i just closed the door and started setting up my computer room while she just followed me and hung around. I went to sleep and woke up with her at the end of my bed. I let her out in the morning on my way to work and when i got home she was waiting for me. Its now been about 3 or 4 days since i moved in and she is still here (currently sleeping on the couch). She looks like she might be pregnant, she has a really big belly but I can't tell. Im planning on taking her to a Vet pretty soon. 
   I attached two photo's of her of when I had found her in the house the second time around, the pictures are kinda blurry though cause she wouldn't stop rolling on the floor and I was using my camera phone. 
   another tid bit of info about the house, the previous owners apparently just got up and left one day and the house went into foreclosure. I bought the house the day it was listed for sale(closed a month later). I think the cat may have belonged to the previous owners of the house but who knows.

I've been a lurker here for years, and most problems inquired get solved with relative ease; I'm hoping you can help me out. 
I made a purchase of 5 shirts on Ebay from the same seller four months ago.

To wrap it up, it's been over 90 days, so I can't file a claim with Ebay or Paypal. Is there anything else I can do? I screwed up by being lazy and not worrying about it for a long time, so if you respond telling me I'm out of luck I'll understand. I feel bad asking you for help, but I simply have no one else to ask that would know. (The total price was $138 so I feel it's worth pursuing.) Thanks for any consideration!",reddit.com

"Hey reddit - how often does your mobile phone ring right when are looking at it, or about 10-15 seconds after you check it? I get this a lot.","I get this far too often. 60% of the time I will think I heard my phone, or wonder if I've missed a call, I will check, and about 5-6 seconds later the phone will start the 'pre-ring' where, in my case, the phone flashes up once, for about 80ms before a ring or vibrate even happens. The phone hasn't started ringing or received a call when I first check.

At other times, I will start looking at my phone, thinking about someone, and within 30 seconds I will get the call (this happens 5-7 times a week, and I never look at my phone for more than a minute and not frequently, i.e. I am not looking at my phone ~3000 times a day for ~30 seconds a time)

I figure there must be some very quiet speaker noises I pick up on for some of the more immediate calls, but then ones that happen much later, when I have a good chance to think about what I was waiting for from the other person, happen frequently enough to make me wonder about probabilities.

So, anyone else get this a lot?

Dear Reddit: My 5 yr old son had this idea before his brain injury in May of '08.  Help me make it happen!,"I run 2 small fruit &amp; vegetable stores in Belleville, IL (just outside of St. Louis, MO) Belleville Farmer's Market. As with most families who's lives revolve around a small family business, conversation around the dinner table is usually focused on the store.  My two sons took a great deal of pride in being able to join in the discussion and my wife and I would always hang on their every word like we were dining with Warren Buffett.  Needless to say, the boys got a big kick out of it.

My oldest son (Reece) was nearly 5 years old when he mentioned that we should let his classmates on our truck and let them sample the fruits &amp; veggies they don't get a chance to try at home.  I was blown away.  My 4 year old had just come up with an innovative, fun way to show kids that trying a bite of celery or broccoli isn't going to hurt them and they might even (shudder at the thought) like it!

That was just a couple months before we were involved in a car accident on May 31st on the way home from Diego Live! in St. Louis.  We were side impacted and Reece suffered a traumatic brain injury that he's still recovering from.  While he works harder in therapy 5 days a week than anyone should ever have to, his Mom and I still haven't heard his precious voice since that day nearly two years ago.

When Pepsi announced that they were going to be giving grants away for ideas that could benefit the community we live in, I knew instantly I had to submit Reece's idea.  Now I need Reddit's help to make Reece's idea a reality.  All you have to do is head to refresheverything.com/tastebuds and vote for us.  Reece and I thank you!!!

A long time friend of mine has not been showering. He recently split up with his fiance and I think he may be severely depressed and potentially even suicidal.

"My friend is going to re-marry a woman who cheated on him, divorced him and exploited him for money.","Here's the situation:

He was married for 2 years, and his wife was always being unfair to him. It didn't bother him, he loved her, and he was happy. But then, there are some signs she's cheating. She disappears, and we find out she ran off with some guy. She comes back six months later in debt and asks for forgiveness, says she's changed. He pays off her debts, which takes about half his savings. She then makes him go on a ""second honeymoon,"" to the Bahamas, calling him unromantic when he cites their financial situation. Then, just as his savings have reached a low, they realize his company might lay him off. She divorces him shortly after. She ran off with some of his money, and leaves him emotionally broken. His work performance is affected, and he loses his job. He's a wreck for a year until he starts to pick things up and gets a new job (but the pay is not as good). He even starts dating again. Since he's a good looking, nice guy, he quickly meets a girl. I'm relieved because she seems like a good person. But then his ex-wife comes back (again carrying some debt), wanting to start things up again. He tells her about his new relationship, but she tells him how much she still loves him, how much it was all a mistake, how he shouldn't give up what they had. She convinces him to break up with his new girlfriend, who is crushed. At first the ex-wife doesn't want to get married, so they have been dating for 6 months. My friend now works a 12 hour job. He seems much more stressed now, but he tells me the money is worth it, since his previous job wasn't as good as the one he was laid off from. I can't be sure his ex-wife pressured him to get this job, but they got engaged pretty quickly after he was hired.

I and some other friends have told him over and over how bad and unfair this is and will be, but the thing is, this friend doesn't really think what his ex-wife did was all that unfair. He's cool and laid back. He never gets mad or retaliates when someone hurts him, just lets it happen. Sometimes he gets really broken (when she divorced him), but he still keeps the people who did it close to him. He doesn't seem to defend himself by avoiding bad people. He's never avoided bad friends, coworkers, and in this case, women.

How do I help him?

**Edit:** Thank you for your replies Reddit. You made me realize that I need to mention: This woman has a magnetic personality and is very convincing with words. Words and people are her forte, unfortunately. She also has a way of making unfair things sound justified. (i.e. tossing away a friend who's going through a really hard time turns into ""I think it's fair to give myself space from someone I'm uncomfortable with."" The more she says, the more you think it's the friend's fault, not hers.) Who knows how reasonable she sounds to him? I think this is really the thing that's making him believe her over everyone else. 

Two friends confronted her after the divorce. They found out that she rationalized and justified her actions. For example, she seemed convinced that she wasn't wrong to divorce him when his savings were low (due to her debt) and risked losing his job because ""it was a healthy financial and mental decision for her."" But she did seem really bothered when accused of being amoral and selfish. She tried hard to justify her actions, and said they were being small minded by judging her based on smaller bits in the past and not believing in her ability to be a better person.

So, not only is she able to convince my friend she's justified, she's able to rationalize her own actions.",reddit.com

"Car owners, please read this and pass it on. If you're ever in a vehicle and you're unable to stop the acceleration, shift into neutral - DO NOT turn the  engine off!","I can't believe how many people are suggesting in this thread that Toyota owners simply turn the engine off if their accelerator sticks! 

**This is advice that could be potentially fatal.**

 I guess I assumed that this was common knowledge, but if you kill the engine while a vehicle is in motion your power steering and power brakes will *cease functioning*! The engine provides power that allows these helpful systems to operate.  You will have a grace period with the brakes from residual pressure that was built up while the engine was powered, but your steering system will immediately become underpowered and sluggish - almost like steering through thick syrup. In addition, there's a chance that your steering column could lock and lose your ability to steer entirely. Obviously this is a less than ideal complication in what is already an emergency situation. 

Please, if you're in a vehicle and you are unable to control the throttle, immediately apply the brakes and shift into neutral. Your engine will rev out of control, but your power assisted systems will remain operational and you will not accelerate. You can then safely guide your car safely to the side of the road and brake unimpeded. Yes, you run the risk of engine damage, but it's a small price in exchange for safely controlling the situation.

Need some advice on how i should handle a situation with my neighbor,"So will try to make this as short as possible but it is a bit complex, i am worried about the safety and security of a child and possibly his mother.

I moved in to my current appartement about 8 months, love the place and the neighborhood. My next door neighbors are obviously immigrants, asian, maybe filipino but not sure. 

Do not really know them, our first meeting was not so good mostly my fault, i reacted badly when i found them visiting my appartement without my permission (the landlord decided to let them in without asking me, really pissed me off). We mostly just nod hello when we run into each other in the hallway at this point, so i guess mostly neutral.

Anyways last week the mother knocked on my kitchen door, this in itself is pretty unusual since the kitchen door leads out to the fire escape that neither of us uses.

She proceeds to tell me that her child is locked into the bathroom of her appartement and that she herself is locked out (this is in montreal, 15 below wearing only a t-shirt and shorts) and needs my help to get him out.

She has not keys and wants me to crawl into the bathroom using the window and break the door down.

At this point i take responsability for not thinking, i was faced with a very histerical mother and a crying child and my first instinct was to help them immidiatly and not do what i should of done and ask questions and more then likely call the police to have them sort it out.

What i did was to crawl into the bathroom and break the door down. This was not easy, i assumed the door was simply locked and the kid was not able to unlock it but it was not the case, turns out there was a deabolt on the outside of the door, bottom line the kid (and possibly his mother) was locked inside the bathroom.

Now i do not have children but it seems to me that you should never lock them inside a bathroom no matter what. I am also worried that maybe the mother was locked inside the bathroom with her child possibly by the husband.

I am unsure what to do or even if i should do anything. The way i see it if i don't do anything and this is a case of neglect and abuse i could be endangering the childs life, if i choose to call the authorities and i am wrong i could possibly make their lives a living hell for no good reason.

Not sure what to do.

UT plans to shut down renown music venue because the venue doesn't make them enough money.,"For those of you not in Austin, and those that are here but don't know this place, the Cactus Cafe is a little bar and music venue located on UT's campus. The venue has been around for over 30 years, and it is one of the few music venues dedicated to music, not profit, scenesters, or glory. The worst thing about this complaint the university is making about the Cafe is that they don't make enough money. Now, while this would normally make sense, in this case it is a bit tricky. The higher levels at the university don't like the fact that there is a FULL SERVICE bar on campus, so, the university prohibits the Cactus from any type of advertising. Most people at UT only learn about the Catcus from friends that have been there. If the school would rethink and allow the Cactus to advertise, then the situation would turn around quickly.",reddit.com

"Hey Reddit, ever heard of the Windows driver Verifier?","I was having alot of issues with a BSOD problem and i knew it had to be a problem with a driver but System Restore wasnt doing any good.

"i predict the ipad will save the (small) newspaper AND (big) publishing industries, and here's why","i worked in the newspaper business for a decade. newspapers spend a lot of money on two things: newsprint and subscribing to the associated press and other press syndicates. these subscriptions allow them to run nation and world stories and, more importantly, give them access to vast resources such as op-ed columnists, thousands of feature stories, photos from around the world, a gigantic notable people mug shot database, GIS data, comics pages, horoscopes and tv listings.

newspapers have always been printed on paper. these people know no other way. it's painful how awful newspaper web sites can be. i was on the inside. i was an integral part of agonizing discussions on what we were willing to put on our web site, how much time and energy and money we were willing to devote to it.  after everything was done and said, it was going to have to be free content. we all knew it, and to fool ourselves into thinking people were going to pay to surf to our web site and read the news was just silly. 

even the new york times, which has had a pretty nice web site -- easily navigable, freely available content except for their columnists -- is now going to charge for most everything. and yet they know it's not going to work.

meanwhile, hundreds of magazines have shuttered their doors in the last couple of decades. people can't afford books these days, and publishers have long cast their fates with only tried-and-true money making authors. all this because printing books and fancy four-color magazines is an expensive enterprise.

besides being a journalist, i'm an avid reader. i have read e-books on my palm pilot and it's not much fun. i've looked at a kindle and i wasn't so impressed. the technology is lacking somehow. it's too ethereal to pinpoint what the disconnect is, though.

besides being a journalist, *and* an avid reader, i'm also a mac person. i like the way apple does things so intuitively. i hate arguing with pc people about why i love macs, just suffice it to say that it's way, way easier to teach an old person or someone who is resistant to the whole concept of computers how to use a mac than a pc. it's just the way it is.

what i've seen of the ipad impresses me a lot. 

i really want to read books on it. i'd eagerly pony up as much as five bucks to read a book on an ipad, rather than at least eight bucks for a paperback book or twenty plus dollars for a hardback, or being pressured to read a book from the library in a week or two after having to wait to even get my hands on it. 

i want to read newspapers on it too. and i'd be willing to pay the local newspaper as much as i am now for the print edition to read high quality content on an ipad. with one important caveat: the content be free of all advertising and just be local and state news. i can catch cnn on the teevee or online for the rest. i don't think i'd be willing to pay the new york times for their content, but i'm sure other people would be more than happy to fork over the cash.  

i think i'd like to read a magazine on the ipad too. and a few other specialized publications. 

newspapers in small and medium-sized markets fill a void. there's no real place for a town that doesn't have a tv station to get the local news. not on the internet, except for the local paper's web site. large-market newspapers no longer provide a timely product. it's too hard to compete with news stations that are affiliated with larger and more monied news conglomerates that provide the product almost instantaneously. they can't continue to provide a product with stale content monday through saturday, and then a feature heavy edition on sunday using an antiquated technology that costs a ton of money.

there will be knock-offs of the ipad but, as usual, apple's blazing a trail ... in the world of *reading* this time.",reddit.com
"Hey Reddit, hate Bank Of America?  Unable to recover outrageous overdraft fees?  See inside...","So last week I made a PayPal transaction that cost $18 with only $6 dollars in my bank account (I have two bank accounts one with BOA and the other is with RaboBank.  RaboBank is my Primary as I am living in the Netherlands.)  Anyways this left my account negative 12 dollars.  So they charged the $35 overdraft fee which would be expected - and hey it was my mistake so I was happy to own up to it.  But then PayPal decided to charge two separate transactions totaling 33 cents.  Well the account being negative now $47.00, one transaction for $0.25 and the other for $0.08 added another two $35 overdraft fees now bringing my total negative balance to $117.  But wait, apparently in June BOA decided to enact a new overdraft fee called an ""Extended Overdrawn Balance Charge"" which is another $35 fee in which isn't caused because of a transaction posting but rather when the account is overdrawn more then 5 days.  So this brought my total account balance to negative $152.00 for going less then 13 dollars in the red.  This to me seemed not only outrageous but morally wrong (ever heard of usury?) 

So I made the long distance call from the Netherlands to BOA's 800 number and after a short hold was on the phone with a nice young lady who immediately advised after I mentioned what I was calling about that there is nothing she can do and could pass me to a supervisor - so I say ok no problem.  The supervisor gets on the phone with a very cold and uncaring attitude and gives me the same speech on how there is nothing they can do to return fees but I could request a call back from someone higher up which could take 24 to 48 hours.  I argue with her for about 5 minutes before realizing that they really could give a shit.  

Now I am pissed.  Not because I don't have money and cant afford the insane fees, but rather its become about principal.  So I get on the Google and start searching around forum posts to which I see tons of other people in way worse situations complaining about their customer service and the way that the BOA generally mistreats their customers.  While reading through a woman's tragic tale of misfortune and some $1000 in racked up bank fees she posted this Gem **1-704-386-5687**  This number is to BOA executive support.  I called them, told them everything that happened and within 5 minutes I had $140 worth of overdraft fees returned - without hassle.  If anyone out there is getting killed by fees and has a legitimate excuse or hardship, this is the number to call, not the 800 number.

I will say one last thing.  I plan on getting back to the US in June for a holiday.  The first thing I plan on doing is closing my BOA account and opening a account at my local credit union.",reddit.com

"Surviving a Super Bowl party for people who aren't familiar with the game, as explained by an American who knows very little about football.","A friend from Singapore recently asked me to give him a crash course in American football for a Super Bowl party he's attending, as well as whom to root for in the Super Bowl.  I've included my response below in hopes that someone out there in the Interwebs might find it beneficial.

American football, as I understand it, is roughly 11 minutes of action spread out over three hours, so the sport is predominately about getting together with friends, eating excessive amounts of unhealthy food and screaming a lot. There's a ball involved in the game, and teams march the ball up and down a field by running and passing in hopes of crossing a boundary line to score points, while the opposing team tries to prevent them from crossing the boundary line.  Beyond that, the rules get somewhat arcane so just yell when everyone else yells and you'll be fine.  If you'd like to blend in a bit more, occasionally making reference to how the offensive line needs to protect the quarterback and/or expressing delight over a particularly hard hit via a loud ""OOOOOOOOOH MAN that dude just got CRUSHED!!!""  will do the trick.  You'll know when to make these comments because the telecast will replay the moments four or five times from four or five angles. 

Inevitably there will be someone at the party who will offer in-depth analysis on every aspect of the game; keep the conversations short and just agree with whatever he says.  It's best that way.  Because I am not sure who will be playing in the Super Bowl this year, and i can't be bothered to look it up, I made a Pascal's Square to help you decide whom to root for.

Reddit: you've officially pissed me off (Korean propaganda posters),"On the front page there is a link to some North Korean propaganda posters. The thread is obviously filled with people making fun of them. What pissed me off the most is the people mocking the last poster, saying things like ""Yeah I throw babies down wells every day"".

Less than a month ago a redditor made this submission:


The TLDR version: a man had been a helicopter gunner, and they'd throw peoples' families, including children, out the door of the copter and into the blades of another one hovering below them.

The recent deaths of civilian children at the hands of Blackwater show the practice is alive and well to this day.

A question about acceptance of science for the religously inclined...,"Why do religious groups find it necessary to try and find scientific facts that purportedly support any number of religious claims? As I understand it, religion is a faith based practice. Faith is a belief and complete trust in something that isn't tangible. Faith is not something based on the logical infrastructure developed by modern science. Furthermore, as I see it, religion doesn't have to be consistent with what any branch of science has revealed to us through years of experimentation. The natural extension of this is that a truly religious person could almost completely reject the world (including science itself!) that has been described by science, and insist that only God knows the truth behind everything (I'm not suggesting that you should do this, but it seems to be a natural extension). 


How can you accept the validity of antibiotics and space travel, but not something like stem cells? Sure, they argue that we're ""playing God"" and killing babies, but all of the assumptions behind that argument are grounded firmly in science. For all a religious person knows, some kind of magic could happen between pregnancy and a baby being born. Gestation could be a ruse, a plot by the devil to tricking you into believing the evils of modern science. Again, I'm not suggesting that this is true, and I'm not trying to make fun. What I'm trying to say is that one could argue that for a religious person, the world is only defined by what is taught in the Bible, and that all other things can't be trusted. 

How do you find a middle ground between believing only what the Bible teaches and what science teaches?",reddit.com
Gay Marriages have nothing to do with God. Or do they?,"From what I understand of marriage, it was originally intended to signify the union between a man, a woman, *and God*. However, for most people today it simply represents a declaration of the love between two people (supported by a contract allowing the couple certain legal rights).

So what is all the fuss about gay marriage? Let them get married! They're not looking for a union with God, are they? Well if they are they should strongly consider reading the bible to make sure they understand how he truly feels about them.

Marriage allots a couple certain legal provisions; those provisions should have no religious prerequisite. Therefore, anyone should be able to get married regardless of their religious affiliation or non-affiliation.",reddit.com

"Dear reddit, I received my first job offer today and I have some questions...","So after 6 months out of college, countless applications and resumes, I finally got a job offer today. Seeing how this is all new to me, I thought I might pose a few questions to see what the working portion reddit has to say about it.

 So the job is for a radiation health scientist (I was a physics major) and it is about four hours away from where I am living now, so it would be a definite move. My dilemma here is that I am not sure if it is really a job that will lead to a career directly, it pays well enough for a starting position (46K), but other than looking decent on my resume it doesn't seem like its a ""career builder"". My question I guess is, if that is what I should be looking for with my first job because I have been getting different advice from my family and friends. For example, my Dad has been working as an engineering at the same company for over 30 years, it was his second job, and he has had it for this long. And his opinion is that if its not going to turn into a career, then it is not worth moving away for (that is kind of the short version of his opinion). 

For a little more background, it was in my head when I graduated college that I wanted to get an entry level physics related or engineering job, work for a year or so, get a feel for what it would be like working a job that I could get with my undergraduate degree, and if that didn't seem to fulfilled me, then go back to graduate school for physics or engineering. Like I said, I am new to this (not all that young though, 26) and not really sure what the best course of action might be, and I know it has to be my choice because it is my life that I am stuck living, but any advice/words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated. 
(sorry for the poor formatting and grammar)

edit- I just wanted to say thanks to all of those who offered advice and dropped a little workforce knowledge on me. As of now I am leaning heavily towards accepting this job tomorrow...",reddit.com

"Newsmax publishes push poll against healthcare reform. Reddit, you know what to do.","

I'm sure this is no news to anyone, but this organization is behind a bunch of push polls on various issues, resulting in lopsided results. 

Read up on Newsmax if you're interested: Newsmax Wikipedia

The way they do it is by asking their polling questions in such a way that the only possible reasonable answers will ""push"" the results in a certain direction. For added insurance that only people of a certain political orientation will complete the poll, they require a valid email address, to which they will send their propaganda. You have no choice about this if you want to post your choices. 

In this particular poll, you're asked who you voted for in '08. Can't imagine how this would have anything to do with whether or not you support Obama's plan for health care reform. Kinda fishy.

Why is it okay for Rahm Emanuel to insult an entire group of people and no one is calling for his head?,"Let me preface this by saying that I am a socially liberal independent.  However, I have a real problem with the double-standard that is happening right now.  If any progress is to be made in Washington D.C. it must start with the top.  Rahm Emanuel should be dismissed or at very least be held accountable for his actions by holding a press conference and apologizing for his words and then be put through counseling.


I just feel like we need to start cleaning up Washington.  Mr. Emanuel is in a position that cannot use this type of language.  Behind closed doors or not he must remember the position he is in.  This is childish and extremely hurtful to some.  Might I add that I am not, necessarily, offended by this.  I simply believe that our leaders need to be held to a higher standard and set precedence for the rest of us.  If we believed that Trent Lott should be canned for his words then why not Rahm?

I have $12.5k in my savings account.
I paid $1,175.00 in interest last year towards my car.

With simple math, if I payed my car off now, I am left with roughly $4,000 in my savings.  After my car is paid off, I will have an additional $500 a month to put into my savings.

My monthly reoccuring costs (without car payments) are at about $1200-$1300 (rent, bills, insurance, etc)

I like to spend no more then $150 a week, $250 if there is something special going on. 

With this, I am at about $2050 cash spent per month.

I earn roughly $3900 net per month, which would allow me to put about $1850 a month into my savings account.

These numbers are obviously not absolute, but very close.

I really want to start my Roth IRA this year, and want to dump the max contribution as soon as I get it, save for a house, but also save money for JUST IN CASE.  I feel very confident my job is safe for the year or until I decide to leave. Besides, we have a kick ass severance package :P

How to save hundreds on your iPhone bill,"This applies to U.S. owners suffering under the yoke of AT&amp;T only, probably.

I have an iPhone, which I love, but having lost my job recently I was trying to cut corners wherever I could.  I found a way to cut the cost down from $90/mo. to almost nothing.  There was an early termination fee of about $100 (it's $175 - $5 * months into your contract), but that's only one month's service on your phone.  I thought I'd share this with the reddit community.

Long story short: I went to my local AT&amp;T store and told them I had bought a new phone and wanted to set up a GoPhone account.  They provided me with a SIM card, free of charge.  I jailbroke and unlocked my iPhone (not sure whether that was necessary), put that SIM card in my iPhone, and now it still works as a phone, but I'm paying more like $10/mo.

This is an especially good deal for those of you who, like I, use their phone rarely.  However, you can still set up a plan where even frequent users will end up saving a lot of money in the end.  If there's interest in this post, I'll provide more details and links.",reddit.com

"Dear Reddit, let me tell you about the hardest thing I had to do in a long time.","I just threw away my old TV.  Now before you deride my overreaction to this seemingly insignificant act, let me tell you a story.

The TV I just threw out was a 25"" Sony, and it was 22 years old; I'm 23.  I didn't actually watch that much TV when I was young. Watching the tube was a basically a reward my parents granted me and my sister for doing chores, completing homework, etc.  Given all the ""Power Rangers"" and ""Doug"" that's pour through that screen, a significant part of our childhood was shaped with that TV.

I remember the wonderful feeling of accomplishment in figuring out how to connect all the ports to different accessories, like a VCR or a cable box, and making everything work.  I'm a computer engineer now.

At some point our family did get a new TV, and this Sony was pushed into the garage.  When I learned how to drive, I would use it as a gauge for my parking distance.  It collected dust there for some years.

I grew up, went to college and decided I wanted a TV in my dorm.  So I wiped the dust off, strapped it into the back seat of my car and drove down California.  There, my Sony provided some great movie nights, and a backdrop for many make-out sessions.  I've since graduated, found a job, and moved again.

This TV has adorned my apartment living room for the last two years providing solace after a long day's work.  But it started showing signs of it's age;  it developed a very slight whine, I couldn't read the font on some XBOX games, and I had to replace the speakers.  Finally, I yet again had to move and decided that this old box of bolts had to be retired.

Tonight, I carried it down to the dumpsters, and was struck with this sentiment.  I ponder: how many memories has my oldest possession witnessed?  To think of all the home movies, Disney classics and world news that had been projected within that dark gray frame.  There are still stickers stuck to the side that my little sister had placed there years ago.  But life goes on.

"Wow... I had a scary experience in my 2010 Toyota Prius today! If you drive one, I urge you to read this for your safety.","I been following the news about toyota cars and their acceleration problems, however, I really haven't care much for it, since I drive a 2010 Prius, and figured it really does not affect me, but little did I know.


Today I was driving down my road heading out, now my road leads to a very busy main road, which is located in a industrial area, as a result, there are a lot more big rigs on that road than the average road.


Due to the way I drive my car--thank goodness--I always try to drive with the least amount of gas usage, so as I was approaching the intersection, which I have a stop sign, I applied my brakes. At the time I was probably going 15 MPH. I started slowing down to a halt, when all the sudden, the car fucking started accelerated forward!


I am telling you my heart skipped a beat, and I thought that I was going to get killed by one of these trucks doing 45-50MPH. The acceleration lasted only for a fraction of a second, and then disappeared and the car came to a halt with my nose just barely over into the intersection. 


I want to point out, I know for a fact that I did not hit the accelerated, because my foot never changed positions, just in case some one might suggest that.


Also one more thing I think might have saved my life, is my driving style, If I was one of those drivers that waits till the last second to push their break, and that same thing would have happened, I am sure the results would have been tragically worse.


I plan on calling my dealer tomorrow, and tell them what happened, is there anything else I should do?


Also in the mean while, if you do drive a Prius, please be careful when approaching intersections!",reddit.com

Wednesday morning, I get an email that says 'We need to talk.""  He is at work, so I figure he's too busy to chat online or call me and I dont think much of it.  That evening, he comes home, calls me, and says ""Something is broken between us after yesterday and I cant deal with it.

Until the fog clears, that is, and I remember that I didnt do anything to him to cause this.  Then I'm angry.  I feel cheated.  Robbed.  I lost my love and my best friend that day and I still dont understand why.  I think, ""What did I do to deserve this?!'  I'm repulsed by the guilt and angst I still carry to this day and I'm not sure its a wound which will ever heal.  This scares me...because I want to kill the ghost of him that haunts my heart and maybe make some room for someone else in there at some point.  Which is healthy, true, but the very thought of doing that makes me hurt and angry and confused all over again.

"Avatar is at a disadvantage in the ""All-Time Adjusted for Inflation"" race.","I see all these post about Avatar being the Box-Office king and people always bring up Gone with the Wind as a counter. I loved both of these movies I'll admit it and while its true GWTW made $1.5 Billion domestic adjusted is was also in the theater a freakishly long time. You have to remember that even more so than Avatar in 1939 GWTW wasn't just a movie, it was a huge event, a spectacle. It stayed in the theater for over a year, it was re-released at least 6 additional times in '47 '54 '61 '67 '71 and '89. If adjust GWTW's ticket prices are $12-21 in todays money each. 

   Even Titanic was in the theater for 10 months, E.T. for a year and the Disney films were released many  many  times. Avatar has only been out 6-7 weeks... what it has accomplished is staggering in that time frame, nothing in history even compares. I think that if Avatar is given the same 10mos. that Titanic was given it 
could easily challenge GWTW, maybe even top $2 billion domestic, but in the digital age it isn't likely to happen.

"Seriously, reddit? We're promoting murder videos to the front page now?","This is regarding the video of a man being pushed in front of a train that has recently become popular in the Pics subreddit.

I'm Australian. I'm sure you understand I appreciate freedom of expression and hate censorship. At the same time, I feel like common sense and courtesy should also be used. The pics subreddit is typically full of cute animals, funny signs, or good photographs. I don't expect to see VIDEOS of MURDERS in the pics subreddit. Yes, the title warned that it was something disgusting. To me, 'disgusting' in the pics subreddit indicates an injury, someone vomiting, a scary animal - something like that. Not a video of someone's death for fuck's sake. Not posting a very direct warning telling people that they are about to look at a video of a man being murdered just seems like a dick move to me.

While my relationship with this site has been rocky, I've never been one to preach that we're going to hell or that we've become 4chan. Hell, I embrace rage comics and several other memes, when they're funny. But I don't think the old reddit would've had snuff films on its front page. And that's not the reddit I want to be a part of.

Upvote whatever you want. I'm not going to tell you not to. I hate censorship more than anything. But please, if you're going to post something like that, put a very direct warning in the title. And consider that if you're upvoting, too.

[P.S. If you disagree to the above, can we at least agree that videos don't belong in the pics section, even if they're technically in gif format?]",reddit.com

The distance was hard and painful, so I finally decide that it would be mentally healthier for me to break up with him. We remain good friends. We still loved each other and hoped it could work out in the future. I start a new relationship, but my ex takes the break up really hard, especially when I refuse to see him because it would be emotionally unhealthy for me while trying to get over him. We end up getting together a few times. He later starts a new relationship, too. For the next three months, we talk less, start to get over each other.

But then, my boyfriend says he could be interested in this other girl if he got to know her better. I am in no way ok with this, and we break up.

He doesn't want us to say ""I love you"" anymore (even though we've been saying it this whole time) because of his girlfriend.

I'm hurt. I felt us drifting, so I make plans to fly out and see him. I try to work a plan with him to be together in the future. He's frigid about this and says I shouldn't call anymore because I bother his girlfriend. A few emails later, he disappears for months. I email him, call him, text him, tell him how angry/hurt I am, how his girlfriend has him under her thumb. Then she calls me, just asking for my thoughts. I politely told her that I was *not* a threat to her; I wanted my ex a year or more from then. They wouldn't even be in the same place by then because of school and careers. But still nothing.

But then, I get a call from him. He goes on to say, after not talking to me for *six months*, how the whole thing was my fault.

Do You Understand World Debt ??  Try this map.,"


... it's a subject that has been done to death especially on the Economics reddit.  I thought I got it, but well - I don't.

So  who is the creditor ?

Is there some mobster threatening to smash us if we don't pay up ?  No.  What then, is creating the pressure on our economies and societies ?

If we are all suffering cut backs, job losses and recession, because we are simply in debt to EACH OTHER ....why don't we just cut each other some slack ?

Obviously I'm interested in switching banks, but I don't want to scrap the convenience of being able to access an ATM or bank from the few large cities I frequent. I'm also interested in avoiding large fees and overdraft charges.

* The average Redditor is not, nor will they ever be, a calendar girl.

* The average Redditor will never have the lightning strike of insight/luck which will enable to get them a 'best comment' award.

* The average Redditor does not possess the insane style of creativity required to get the 'most inciteful' award.

* etc, etc. Pick any award (except the yearly ones). Most of us will never come close to winning them because we're mostly lazy, kinda talentless, and don't make up for it with great fortune. **And that's OK**. It applies to me, too.

So here's some Joe Sixpack type awards that would be awesome to see added. More suggestions are welcome:

* **Tarred and Feathered** - Comment rated below -15

* **Get the Rope** - Comment rated below -30

* **Meme Master** - (Thanks to Mapguy for the idea) - Successful (20 or more upvotes) use of a Reddit-wide accepted meme. Trophy appearances can differ - A picture perfect application of ""And my Axe"" will land you a different looking trophy than a well-played, ""You're doing it wrong"".

* **Mr. Mediocre** - 50 consecutive comments with none of them being rated above a +10 or below -5

* **I Got Nothing** - Upvoting/Downvoting 100+ comments/links in a row without making any kind of post whatsoever.

* **STFU** - A post/link which has more than 50 overall votes, and most of them must be downvotes.

Just wanted to let you guys know that the browser wars are over.,"The Winner: Google Chrome.

Man, did I ever want Firefox to win. It was the first and the best, and the gettinest and customizablest (warning, not all of the previous are words)

But I got tired of waking up in the morning and jumping to my PC and finding that El Memory Gordo had locked up, or--in really bad cases--killed my system so I couldn't do anything but hit the power button.

And my machine is not wimpy. I am still comfortably in the safe mode for running games. I can't do super HiRez that game that everyone benchmarks by... the shooty one... with the armor and... Koreans? 

(It makes me crazy that I can't see an Asian girl or type the word ""Korean"" and not have my heart lurch and want Angela Kim back...)

Anyway. So Firefox is a suck. And I love it. And I kept trying. 

But eventually it was just because I didn't fully trust Chrome. And I wanted to fuck with Firefox still.

But I've been using Chrome at work and am super pleased that it flits around like a butterfly even when I'm running illustrator on a government issue XP machine... 

(not 100% true. I get a better one because I do Video stuff, but it's from the NSF and still at barely CS level) 

And so... I'm deciding to go with Chrome at home. For a while. Sorry Mozilla, I want you guys to win, but it's got to be about competition and you're gonna have to catch up. Love you though.

Keep in mind too that I still keep a version of IE on my computer for those very very rare instances when I can't do something important unless it's IE. You can't prepare for every instance, FF, but YOU DON'T GET LAZY OR I'M DROPPING YOUR ASS TOO CHROME.

Sigh. Anyway. The big guy wins. Better big guy than most, but...

Finally! Some instant karma! Some jackass gets pulled over.,"So I was in the truck with my dad for lunch and we are in stop-and-go traffic. My city has terrible traffic and the rain wasn't helping. We're inching our way down the freeway and my dad rolls his car slowly forward to close the gap between him and the car in front of us. Some dick-bag in a gas guzzler pick-up honks at us for not gassing up to the car in front of us and slamming on our breaks. We deal with pushy drivers often, my family and I, but honestly, there isn't more we can do to exacerbate the situation we are already in. We're already going slow as balls.

So the guy in the big truck changes lanes and eventually gets about 4 car lanes in front us. We're coming up to the intersection and this guy is in a REAL ""hurry"" (just like 90% of drivers in our city). The light changes to yellow and this guy isn't even close to the intersection! He guns it and obviously blows through a red light. I see this happen *all the time*! 

But then a motorcycle cop pulls into the emergency lane, puts on his lights, and zooms to pull the ass-hat over.

"I've been defending Texas for years on Reddit, but you know what, fuck Texas.","Let me introduce you all to the Texas Surcharge program. 


Feel free to research this disaster of law yourself, but let me give you my personal story.

Awhile ago I was on my way to Blockbuster and forgot my license. 
I was pulled over and ticketed for driving without a license.
*This is where I screwed up big*
All I had to do was go to the courthouse, show my license and pay $10.00 and the charge would have been dismissed. Instead, I was distracted by impending move to Oregon and forgot. My fault 100%. Not arguing that.
Fast forward two months. 
I receive a notice that I was ticketed for driving without a license in Texas and that I owed $323.00 to the courthouse in Grapevine. I paid the ticket and full and continued my life, feeling like and idiot for wasting $323.00. (little did i know that was just the beginning.)

Fast forward about six weeks.
Car packed, I'm on my way to Oregon. Goodbye Texas, nice to know you. On the way, I'm pulled over in New Mexico. The officer informs me that I'm driving on a suspended license. Suspended license? This is news to me. He tickets me and allows my mother to drive the rest of the way. I send $415 to the courthouse in New Mexico to pay the ticket and full and call the DPS in Texas to see why my license is suspended. 

As it turns out, I had been placed on the surcharge program the moment I received my initial citation for driving without a license (from the Blockbuster trip). The surcharge program requires a payment of $35/month over the next 3 years, on top of every ticket I had already paid. Well, I was never once notified of this program and because of my failure to pay, my license was suspend. Well, that sucks. I pay all $750 of the surcharge immediately plus an additional $100 fee for reinstating my license and get my license renewed.

That lasted for 1 month, until I received another letter in the mail. Because of my ticket in New Mexico for driving on a suspended license, I was being placed on the surcharge program again. Another $750, another $100 for my license, only this time, because I am a repeat offender, I need to add sr-22 insurance to my policy, in Texas. So, even though I don't even live in Texas, I know have to add a Texas based insurance policy to my account. 

I'm now broke, I've lost my job because it requires a valid license and I can't afford to pay my upcoming school tuition. On the bright side, I guess I can sell my car now.

Does anyone give music lessons?,"I dropped outta the rat-race last year. Seven months ago to be exact. Sold my interest in my business for a tidy sum. Paid off the bills, have zero debt, and paid off the house. I have my retirement as set as anybody I know, but I'm only 40 and the ""golden years"" are quite a looooooonnnnngggg way away.  I basically have no worries in life now but one: I'm bored shitless!


I've been playing guitar for 22 years. 10(ish) years playing paid gigs off-and-on over that 22 years. I really, *really* need something to do with my time. I'm not about to go out and get a job -- don't need the money and have vowed to ""take a few years off, dammit!"" before I head back into the rat race, but I can't take this nothing to do all day long, every day of the week. After a while, you catch up on all the projects 'round the house, and then there's a ton of NothingToDo™. 


So, I'm putzing around on my guitar this evening and thought: Hell, I'm playing all day just for something to do. Might as well share the knowledge/skill, and see if I can't make a little money at it too. I fully understand that I won't make significant sums of money, I'd just like for the music to finance itself. If I want a new guitar, or a new amp, or some new gizmo for the PA/sound system or studio, then why not have it a ""break even"" -- buy the toys with money earned from the music. 


Has anyone out their given music lessons? I'm not picky -- it doesn't matter if you've taught piano, guitar, music theory, drums, or friggin' piccolo. 


What were your experiences?


How did you get started?


What are the ""gotchas"" that you wish you knew or someone had told you before you started?


Did you go truly independent, or were you affiliated with a music store or school system with a music department?


Basically, can you give me a brain dump on anything you think might be of interest to someone starting. 


FYI -- I was an instructor for several years in the US Army. I am no stranger to knowledge transfer to students (however I don't think folks would respond well to the typical Army-style training for guitar lessons &lt;grin&gt;). 


Thx!

Epiphany: We are made of star stuff,"I was listening to the Symphony of Science stuff that someone else posted a few days ago and I was really struck by something that Tyson and Sagan said in one of the songs. 

We Are All Connected

Neill DeGrasse Tyson says, ""I know that the molecules in my body are traceable to phenomena in the cosmos . That makes me want to grab people in the street and say, have you heard this?""

Then Sagan says:

The beauty of a living thing is not the atoms that go into it
But the way those atoms are put together
The cosmos is also within us
We're made of star stuff
We are a way for the cosmos to know itself

It may be corny, but the music behind that part of the video kind of got to me. I really started to think about this. The very atoms that compose our bodies came from stars and have been around for eons. This is something we all know, but have you really stopped to think about it?

That last thing that Sagan says also really got me thinking. We are conscious beings made from ""star stuff"". We truly are a way for the cosmos to know itself.

We made you something to help navigate video links on reddit,"I have been reading reddit for about two years now and I have always wanted to give something back. Now I have the chance. My company has added reddit to the sites supported by our Google Chrome Extension]( which adds visual summaries for video links. For the impatient, you can see what it does [here.

As a developer at Videosurf, I work to index the video content available on the web, enhanced with computer vision. We have had Firefox and Chrome extensions out for awhile now, but they have generally been geared towards enhancing search results on various sites with visual summaries, as well as other minor site specific enhancements.  However, I found that myself and friends of mine consume a large amount of internet video through sites like reddit, rather than google or yahoo, so I had our extension developer add support for visual summaries on reddit video links.  The results are sprites and thumbnail video strips for any video link on reddit that we have analyzed. And if we haven't analyzed the video yet, the links get added to our processing pipeline and should be available within the day for supported video sites.

A couple of caveats to point out:

1. Currently, this is only supported in the Chrome version of the extension. If there are requests, I will gladly push adding reddit to the Firefox version.

2. The extension does make API calls back to our site to look up the video links on reddit pages you are viewing, but we don't store any specific identifiable user data, such as a reddit username.

So, please try it out and let me know what you think. If you have any questions or comments, don't be afraid to send an email to feedback@videosurf.com. 

You can read a little more about our extensions here.

"Reddit is a sweltering hole of pig manure that is marred by faux liberal outrage, pseudo-intellectuals and pot smoking teenagers.","&gt;You are submitting a text-based post. Speak your mind.

K.

Last week I saw a Youtube video made by an Atheist nerd who looked like a teenage girl. He was whining and complaining about how a few people on Reddit had made fun of his feminine appearance. I didn't really care. If he was that much of a girl's blouse that he had to go and make a vlog about it, he probably (read: definitely) deserved it. As the video went on, this guy made it clear that he was an avid Reddit user. He then said something along the lines of:

&gt;""If you post X, PREPARE to be DOWNVOTED!"" 

What caught my attention was how much effort he had put into saying this. His volume rose and he became much more animated, even going so far as to throw a thumbs down sign with his hands. I laughed to myself thinking, ""Wow. This guy is really just your average run-of-the-mill Reddit user.""

Let me clear a few things up. I'm an atheist myself, and I dislike Fox News just as much as the next sane person. I'm not a Liberal but I'm also not a Conservative. I believe in Pro-Choice. I believe that marijuana should **not** be legalised. I'm not from the US, so I really don't have any preference for either the Democrats or the Republicans. And I'd consider myself more of a fence sitter than anything else.  

What annoys me about Reddit is how biased it is. Only a gang of complete and utter morons could spend their time posting links about how biased Fox News is... while simultaneously performing fellatio on any story or link about something Democrat-related. And as for the ""Legalise Marijuana"" links? Wow. Way to not look like a bunch of angst-riddled teens. How cool and with-it you are Reddit.

&gt;Oomg but alcohol is worse lol 

Another thing that annoys me about this sham of a community is how easily things get downvoted. I was looking at a story on how Bill Gates intended to donate a surreal amount of money to charity when I noticed that 1/3 people had downvoted it. WHY?! What a bunch of mouth-breathers. I've seen a few funny stories, images etc that have had negative ratings. Why? Because some fat pasty-faced virgin with hands that look like rubber gloves filled with margarine decided that just because the link didn't include something about Obama, that it wasn't good enough for Reddit?

That's all I really wanted to say. I'll be on my way now. Oh and before somebody says ""and nothing of value was lost"" - I'd just like to tell you that letting others know that you visit 4chan is not a good idea if you intend on losing your virginity.

Help me design the ultimate desk/workspace!,"So I am planning to redo my office (which is currently a cluttered mess) and put in a custom-built desk.  If I'm going to build it (or, more likely, get it built), I want to do it right.

I work from home a couple days a week as a computer programmer and as a writer, so I need the workspace for computer use primarily.  I'm currently running four computers: my personal laptop (in a docking station, closed), my development machine, a photo system for handling my tens of thousands of photos (I have kids) and a video system for storing videos of the kids.  I want them off in an alcove out of the way.  I use a KVM to switch between them.

Wake up call to Redditors - Handicapped people arn't funny.,"I understand the reddit machine is ever changing and I'm at terms with that. However I feel as a community we should steer our younger/immature brethren in a proper direction. Right now on the pics Reddit we have about 3 pictures on the front page making fun of obese, physically, and mentally challenged individuals. Is this how we we want to represent our community? I know we arn't heartless, I've seen so many accounts people helping each other on this site. 

I want to share personally how this makes me feel. In 1981 my mom gave birth to triplets, one died, one was perfectly normal, and one had cerebral palsy. The nurse tried to deliver the babies without calling a doctor in and completely failed. I grew up with a sister who has cerebral palsy. The sister with cerebral palsy has been in a wheel chair her entire life and will never walk. Were about two years apart and did mostly everything together as kids. I grew up watching grown ups and children alike stare at her like shes some sort of mutant who's about to spew acid from her nostrils. She had to sit at the sidelines at all my football and soccer games and watch all the kids her age run and jump. Can you imagine your entire life sitting on the sidelines watching people physically move around like that knowing youre going to be strapped into a wheel chair until the day you die? Can you imagine never knowing what it's like to run? It's a really painful thought but im very thankful for growing up in this situation being able to share this experience to others who dont see it from that point of view.

Is it really *that* hard to lose weight?,"I've never been fat. I do not understand being fat, though. I mean, is there a life threatening side-effect of just not eating? I understand that it is difficult, that your energy levels drop some (a lot, ok), that you may experience blackouts if you overexert yourself after 4 days or so without food (low blood pressure), and that you will experience some muscle loss. But if you're very, very fat, isn't that worth it? 

Some people with specific types of kidney and liver problems can't just stop eating because they will die - that's pretty rare though. Fat people do not die of starvation. Only incredibly skinny, emaciated, bone-showing people do, right? Is it that large people know what to do, but cannot do it? Is it honestly just a self control issue? Like, really being unable to stop eating?

It seems to me a lot like quitting smoking or other addictive drugs. No real secret, just *stop*. I guess a little different than drugs - I mean you can eat again when you're not fat.

"Ok Reddit, it's time to share our ghost stories !","I've got tons, but I'll share one to start:

Prom night, I'm getting ready.  I don't have the tux on yet.  It's laying on my bed. I leave my bedroom and go to the bathroom to do whatever.  I return, planning on getting in my tux now.  Except the Tux is gone.

I yell to Mom, ""Mom, did you take my tux?  It's gone from my bed!""  She says no and we start looking.  Mind you that Prom starts soon and entrance is excluded if you are late so I MUST FIND MY TUX.  Me and my mom tear apart the room, destroying my nice clean room.  We rip the sheets, blankets, and even the entire mattress off the bed to check to see if it somehow got wedged between the boxspring and mattress.  It's gone.  Completely gone.

We pile the sheets and blankets back onto the bed in a mess and leave the room to look else where because it's clearly no longer in my room.  

Of course, we end up returning to the room and my tux is laid on top of the pile of sheets/blankets now, perfectly neat.

I'll add some more later if this sucker takes off.

**Edit:** I forgot about the cufflinks.  They didn't re-appear until the next morning when we were getting ready to return the tux, laid out on my bed in the little plastic bags.  We thought we were going to get charged for losing them.  Mind you, I slept in my bed that night, they were not there when I went to bed.",reddit.com

Democrats should support the Tea Party.  Here's why.,"It's like when I played football in middle-school and we had the ""fifth-quarter"" squad that would play a mini game at the end of the official one.  It was inconsequential but gave the kids with no talent/size a chance to play without dragging down the real game.

The Tea Party can be that ""fifth-quarter"" squad, it just needs enough support to actually run some candidates to distract them from the real game.  Ultimately the Tea Party candidates won't be taking any votes away from Democrats and will help to shake out some of the worst parts of the Republican Party without any real chance of electing anybody.

First Annual Reddit Online Scavenger Hunt! [w/ details],"Welcome everyone to Reddit's First Annual Online Scavenger Hunt! My name is Richard and I'm going to be serving as gamemaster. 

Reddit players (or teams, if you decide to form them) will follow clues starting with the first 'scroll' given below, which will lead them through a series of paths until they receive the final email address (mine) which they can use to claim the prize. The clues will primarily reveal URLs, which will traverse forums, ebay and craigslist posts, easter eggs in famous painting displays, riddles and codes; each will end by delivering the URL for the next clue, except in three instances where there are special instructions given.

The final sensational and coveted prize after the adventurous, long-winding path will be a post of public recognition by me and a $200 value classic, brand-new (obviously) Casio G-Shock sports watch.

Some tips:
	
1. Many clues have double meanings. EVERYTHING PROVIDED IS SIGNIFICANT. Use your cultural knowledge and sub-textual analysis to combine and form meaningful ideas.
	
2. I've carefully planned this scavenger hunt which will require some codebreaking, careful observation, teamwork, and interactions such as easter eggs/secret user panels from popular websites - even an emailing autobot who will ask a series of riddles via email once you reach the stage (lvl #21) and receive his address. Think outside of the box and realize that more meets the eye than at first glance.
	
3. Working with team members is encouraged, but I recommend that you decide beforehand who will receive the watch, lest there occurs the classic treasure-hunter bickering syndrome part of the way through.
	
Good luck and godspeed. Groups of clues will often come in scrolls, such as the ebay listing group (lvl #18). Every word on these scrolls matter, and you should save scrolls because some clues may be significant later in the game as well. **I present you with the first scroll (lvl #1):**

"Fellow Redditers: Just some thought's and 
questions.","First I want to say that I'm neither dem nor rep, but more libertarian and want the smallest gov possible. Now that you see my pov, let me ask you this and be honest.

Why do you want gov run health care? Can you imagine a hospital run like the DMV? It would be a complete nightmare. I'm 24, have a job and pay close to $200 a month on healthcare and have no complaints what so ever. Last week I went and had my ear flushed(couldn't hear) and it cost $130 then with my insurance, it only cost $10. People should never rely on the government for anything, and if your a single mom with 2 kids, that's not my problem. Society shouldn't be punished financially cause of your issues.

Second, why is abortion such a big deal? People blow it way out of water and make it a central topic, when it only applies to women in the first place, and women have the right to do whatever they want to their body, stop getting your panties twisted cause a politician doesn't want dead babies. Fucking move on to real issues.

Third, weed will never be legalized(unfortunately) and now would be a great time to do it, it could boost the economy. Stop crying cause a politician doesn't like weed, it's not a big deal.

Fourth, I'm an atheist and don't really care what a person believes in. But, like almost all other atheists, hate when religion is pushed onto others. My question is, why the eff does the westboro baptists not get chased out of this country? I would throw tomatoes and break signs if they set up camp at a soldiers funeral in my city. Enough of this tolerance shit.

Fifth, stop blaming bush guys. It was cool from 2003-08, now it's pathetic. everyone needs to stop playing the blame game. This isn't a question, it's more of a just-man up.

Also, this China shit is just distraction stories to make you forget about the forged recovery data and how we are in a DEPRESSION now and have been for some time.

I believe that we should pull out all our troops of the middle east and park predators over the entire area and keep them on watch and maintain the fighting that way. If we have another 9/11, nuke the shit out of the country that holds the responsible party.

Everyone grow up on here and stop being such pussies. That's my rant for the day, and thanks for the onslaught of downvotes.

Ladies: Are you aware of this phenomenon?","I've gotten physical with a few guys before they let me know they were married to women, and I'm constantly surprised at how frequently normal-seeming married guys come on to me.  

The guys I'm talking about are fellas you would NEVER pick out of a lineup.  Some of them are the most butch, regular guys: cops, blue collar guys, etc. (basically The Village People).   And then, of course, there are plenty of the regular professional types: lawyers and judges and church leaders, etc.  But most of them fall easily under the category of ""straight-acting"".  I sometimes think these guys are relatively comfortable with me because--while I'm not in the closet--I act straight myself and am not at all a flamer.

As far as I can tell, the number of men who have had sexual encounters with other men is exponentially higher than the usual statistics would have us believe. Many of the straight guys I've talked to have fond memories of camping trips with friends, nights when they stumbled home drunk, locker room encounters, all sorts of occasions on which things went a little further than normal with another guy.

"Reddit, save my cats' lives!","Here's the situation: my wife and I just closed on a four story townhouse yesterday. Our first house! That's not the issue. The issue is the fact that there's an open column that runs the entire height of the building. Column's size is about 8' x 4' x 4 stories.  
  
We have two cats that have never lived outside of a one-story building. In addition, they are both klutzy. I am certain that they are going to walk up the stairs to the top of the column, decide that they need to see what's outside the window on the opposite side, and completely miss, falling 40 feet to the bottom floor.  
  
My wife has finally acquiesced and allowed me to implement some sort of safety feature which will keep the cats from committing kitty suicide.

My Theory of Attractiveness,"Here's my theory: In order to be attractive to the opposite sex, you have to be considered the best of whatever group you are a part of and that's all. For instance if there are only 5 guys in a group A (either because they are isolated, as in a camp for teens, or because they are just in a group of friends) the one who has the best combination of personality and good looks out of the 5 will be attractive to the women in the group. This does not mean that the person would be the most attractive in other groups however. If the most attractive person in Group A were to move to Group B in which he was not the one with the best personality and good looks, he would no longer be attractive to most of the women in Group B if they did not know him when he was in Group A. Often, this is how normally unattractive (either mentally or physically) people get a partner.
The strange thing about this is that when a woman meets another man outside of their school or their group of friends, and the man is introduced to the group of friends/schoolmates it quickly becomes apparent to everyone that they are not the most attractive person in the new group and the woman is seen as having picked an unattractive person to date. But, if they had seen him when the woman met him, they would realize he was attractive in the context of whatever group he was in.",reddit.com

"Need help, Reddit!  I have a douchebag neighbor!","Ok Reddit, this is gonna be long:

I posed a question to Reddit a few months ago about my douchebag neighbor. 

Here's the TL;DR version of that post:  ""My neighbor is a douchebag.  He's very verbally abusive and tries to intimidate me to the best of his ability.  He's confronted my boyfriend and I a number of times and I fear it's only so long before his apparent hatred manifests itself physically.  I just found out that his condo (below mine) is being foreclosed on.  What can I do?""

Most of the advice I got was ""do nothing, he'll be gone soon enough.""  Which, I agreed with, and have had as little contact with him as possible since our last confrontation. 

Well, his house was not sold at auction, so apparently they worked something out with the bank.  As I said, I've had almost no contact with him for 3 months or so.  Last night around 9:30pm, I had a piano delivered.  Having a 3rd floor condo, it took a little time and some work for the movers to get it up the stairs.  Well, my neighbor came home right as they were moving the piano in the front door.  I was holding the door for the movers and he slowly entered the door, all the while trying to stare me down.  Even the movers called him a douchebag after he was in his unit.

I didn't say anything to him, he didn't say anything to me.  This morning, I went out to my car to go to work and there were 3 huge loogies on my passenger side window.  I'm 99% sure it was him since he had parked next to me.  

I'm at a loss here, Reddit.  There hasn't really been any physical confrontation (nor do I want it to escalate to that point, even though that could make my life a lot easier), but I'm getting sick of him spitting on my car and making both my roommate's and my life a bitch.

So my Girlfriend is going to dump me.,"I know that it's going to happen, its an inevitability. Its not because we don't love each other, or because we don't want to be with each other.

Well, we're going to different colleges. I'm going into my Junior year of college, while shes going into her freshman year. Its not that we will be far apart, she'll only be a 20 minute drive, but she won't have a car and we wont be able to see each other as often as we both would like. We see each other every day as it is. We play during the days, and cuddle and talk at night. We go out to movies and dinner on the weekends, and i listen to her vent about her less than desirable friends. I go to her piano recitals, and choir concerts, shes just such an amazing person. And I would be willing to work through the distance thing, because seeing her once a week is much better than living without her for a lifetime, but i know shes going want to end this so we don't wind up spoiling what it is we have by letting it drag on into obscurity until we both have nothing left to hold on to. 


So i know what some of you will say - ""if its not meant to be, its not meant to be"", ""theres plenty of fish in the sea"", and the like. I know this. But she was my fish..and for the moment she is my fish, and I love her.


So i guess what i'm driving at here is what can I do to soften the blow, because its going to hit - hard.

The problem with communicators in Star Trek: TNG,"Can someone explain to me how, in Star Trek, when you tap your communicator to speak, the communicator knows who you wish to speak to before you say it.

Example: Data wishes to contact Worf.  He taps the dongle and says ""Lt. Commander Data to Lt. Worf"" and begins speaking.  On Worf's end, he hears the message ""Lt. Commander Data to Lt. Worf"" and knows who has hailed him.

But how is the communication correctly relayed to Worf before Data specifies that Worf is the recipient?",reddit.com
I live in a small town in the deep south. AMA.,"I was inspired to do this after seeing this link: 
... and someone asked what the kid meant by being a Rebel.

I remember this kind of stuff when I was a kid. I live near Andersonville Prison Camp in Georgia, so a lot of that North vs. South sentiment still exists in a strange way. I also live near Plains, GA where President Carter lives.

I'm currently going to the local college, studying to be an actor and hopefully move on from here. I'm not a redneck, but I have lived in various trailers and houses, and my parents live in the country. I know how to hunt and fish, and a pick up truck has been my main mode of transportation at some times.

Just to get a few things out of the way: I'm not a racist. I don't have much of an accent. I don't know anyone who's slept with their sister or seen a UFO. I'm an atheist, even though my family is very religious. I believe completely in science and rationality. I don't generally listen to country music unless it's someone like Johnny Cash or Willie Nelson.

I just snuck into my dad's liquor cabinet.,"heehe! Ok. I know it sounds juvenile, but I am definitely of age and legal to drink. My parents both know I drink (although they don't condone it, my dad will occasionally get some beer and drink it with me and for certain occasions will even get me a bottle of Scotch). However, having relatively exhausted my main bottles I went snooping and found a bottle of evan. I do not know how old it is, but it's some lovely 90 proof! Ah, the sneaking around just made me nostalgic of the times I was in high school and how I learned to love Scotch, basically by raiding the cabinet and taking shots when I got home. What are you drinking on, reddit, oh you scum-hole of the interwebs?

I was wishing in my brain that he did not ask me about it, but he did. 

what happened was not for the faint of heart. I located my beaming rod, about $35 from a sex store. it was a large object reminiscent of a chinese tangler. Anyways, my friends she was slim, curvy and oddly large amount of freckles on her ass. 10 mins later, she was passed out with blood coming from her ears.

My grandma, having been through a similar thing the year before gave him one of her old stress balls.  She had given him this nice pink little squishy pig unfortunately it was not squishy enough for him to grasp correctly so instead she gave him a smiley face bean bag.  

So while we sit their watching  Na Na's favorite movie ""Entrapment"" my brother squeezed this little bean bag so hard that the top blew up in his face.  Now my grandparents are those kinds of people who like their house clean even when there is no one to see it so when this thing blew up over my brother's face and crotch area there was no hesitation to get the vacuum.  Grandma then brought out this large anaconda like vacuum that looks like its  supposed to pick up horse feces and hands it to me. 

There is an awkward pause as I look at the scattered sand on my brothers chest and crotch. So I quickly got up and vacuumed the...uh areas as fast as I could and then Grandma sits down besides me and says in her hilarious French Canadian accent:

"""Dove For Men: Hard as Fuck""","Have you guys seen those Dove For Men commercials? No one is buying this idea, soap is hard to market to dudes. The only way this will be successful is if they have a badass tagline. I'm thinking something like ""Dove For Men: Hard as Fuck"" or ""Dove For Men: Fuck Bitches"".  
  
Or if they're ready make history, ""Dove for Men: Fuck Dove for Men: Fuck Dove for Men: Fuck Dove for Men: Fuck Dove for Men: Fuck...""  
Self referential + recursive advertising is the future. It also captures that ""Buy it or don't, we don't give a shit"" vibe, which is key. Plus it's easy to stretch the 15 second spot to a full 30 second commercial.

"I fled my abusive UK visa sponsor - a 20 year re-
connected University days buddy who has turned 
into the classic Jekyll and Hyde Personality 
Disorder sociopath :(","( I promise I trawled my e-mail for my old reddit user name, just cannot locate it! Am not a newbie here)

In October 2009, I reconnected with my old University friend, whom we had last seen 20 years ago. We were a small bunch of regular University buddies, some studied medicine, others business etc. Good times.

He invited me immediately to spend a few months in the UK as his guest, I have our correspondence via e-mails to confirm this. He was keen to tell me several times that was a ""millionaire"" which was amusing at the time. All expenses for my visit were promised by him to be provided by him, as he seemed rather keen to 'show off' his earnings in the UK. 

To cut a long story short, just 3 days after I landed in (UK city) and in his care, a pattern of sudden, vicious temper tantrums, compulsive lying and threats to me started every few days.  He would switch back to being charming and play the good host - before the narcisstic need to potray himself as a ""generous doctor"", while simultaneously insulting me and verbally abusing me.

 Uncalled for aggression, demeaning comments about our common friends, and me,  being ""poor"" and himself being a ""millionaire"" ( his words! yes, he truly beleives that everyone else is poor and he in the only one with money - not true at all).
 [I found his disorder described to a T here just a few days ago:
 )

After a pattern of abude emerged, I tricked him into getting my passport back ( it was in his safe at his home); alerted the hotel staff where I was staying as his guest, and ticked him off most vehemently and politely in front my the hotel staff. I had requested them to be present as I didn't wish to be alone in the abuser presence at alllllll!

 What I would like to know from redditors is:

1) Can his threat of 'cancelling' the UK visit visa sponsorship be carried out? It seems an empty threat but I won't put anything past his diabolical personality. In his sick mind , the 'whole of the UK is under his control' ( his words!)

2. He is a doctor who has lived and worked in the UK since 1990. He has made some kind of a good life for himself but I wouldn't describe him as the gazzlionnaire he makes himself out to be!

My citizenship is of another country. I realise now that he wanted to invite me so his need to show off his (imagined) riches would be fulfilled; not to re-unite with an old University  friend as I'd thought

3. During the first 3 happy days I was in the UK with him playing 'good host', I'd told him about my other nightmare - my former UK business co-director who is British and a real ahem, not nice person. Since then, the e-mailed threats to me have included this former co-directors name and details...which isn't pleasant ... more of a juicy story there...

TL;DR - I was forced to flee from my abusive UK visit visa sponsor; now I need to know how to protect myself!

"Reddit, I am having the best birthday that I have had since 2004, and I will tell you why...","2004 was the last birthday I had before Facebook became a thing.  This year, I turned off the display of my birthday in my FB privacy settings.  

The quiet that has ensued is best gift I could have given myself.  No more completely insincere notes from people I only hear from once a year.  No more hasty calls from forgetful friends who saw noticed it was my birthday while wasting time at work.  

This is my experience.  The 'FB birthday wish' has been the bane of my birthday for the past few years.  It's reminded me of how few people in my life I have meaningful relationships with.  This year, even though I've only heard from a few people, all I can think about is how those people really care and how lucky I am to have them in my life.  It's a great reminder.  Perhaps I should have just tried to focus on this before, let it rise above the FB noise, but just turning that noise off was also pretty awesome.

Botnets Are Destroying Online Advertising,"Recently I booked a rather large ad campaign with a reputable online advertising company (which for now I choose not to name). The campaign was supposed to run for 5 days and deliver a few hundred thousand visitors. It was not a cheap campaign, and was infact only slightly cheaper than Google AdWords.

After the first day, I started analyzing the Google Analytics data. At first it seemed normal. Decent pageviews/visitor, bounce rate etc. But then I started looking at the content the users from the campaign were hitting. Every page linked from our homepage received an almost identical amount of hits, except pages that are linked twice from the homepage which got double the amount of hits. The forgot your password page was hit as much as the most popular content on our website, and these were new visitors hitting it. The visitors all came from different IPs in many different cities.

From this I could draw only one conclusion. One or more of the publishers signed up with this ad company is using a botnet that randomly clicks ads on their websites and then clicks through random links on the target website.

I did get a full refund from the ad company, but they didn't seem bothered at all and I didn't get the impression that they are going to do anything about it. The referring sites which sent the bot traffic are still displaying ads from this network.

The fraud didn't stop with me. These botnet phantom visitors clicked on ads on our site which means that our sponsored were defrauded as well. I'm pretty obsessed with numbers and analytics but most webmasters and corporations I know would never have caught on to this sort of fraud. 

The frustrating part is that it seems to me like it would be very easy for these ad networks to create a couple of honeypot websites with nonsensical links and content that normal users would never click and catch these botnet users automatically with no overhead. I guess they are either lack the technical folks to do that or that their business actually relies on these botnet operators and without them they won't be able to make any money.",reddit.com

"American Medical Care - best in the world? My brother is a dentist but my molars are rotting and there's little he can do to help because I""M NOT FUCKING INSURED.","This is really about dental care but whatever. I had top notch, insurance supplied dental care until I was 24 when I was dumped out into the cold, dark night. I had one cavity in those 24 years; I haven't had dental insurance since then, and now I have seven. Four require a root canal, or did, the last time I could afford a checkup, TWO YEARS AGO. 

It's now been four years since I've had *regular* dental service, and I've developed a carie in each of my last molars that require root canals. Each canal will be $750, for $3k total. I don't have insurance, and I make about $20,000/yr with about $10,000/yr in education expenses. 

The kicker? MY BROTHER IS A DENTIST. He could do this all for me for free if I wait another, oh, five years. He only graduated a few years ago, so he's got student loans to pay back, which means he doesn't own his own office, he's an employee of a dental corporation. Even if he volunteers his own time, he has to charge me for the office space, the equipment usage, the assistants time, and so on and so forth. I know he'd do it for free if he could, but his hands are tied - there's no way to knock that price down because he's not in charge and can't make decisions like that.

So... America... one of the wealthiest, best developed nations on Earth, and I can't get a couple basic dental procedures done because I am not a valuable enough life to bother with providing me with those basic services. It doesn't matter that I'm studying to be an Engineer and will probably earn millions of dollars in my life - *right now*, when I need care, society has deemed me worthless and not deserving of basic assistance.

I'm lucky, my molars don't hurt me (yet, always), but sometimes they ache. Lately I've been getting headaches, though, and I can't help but wonder if it's related. 

Before anyone bitches about me not being responsible or something, I've got about $1000 cash money available right now, and I can either have an checkup ($300) and get one tooth fixed, or pay my car insurance for six months (legally required) and fix my laptop (pretty much a necessity for my schoolwork). I will also ignore any suggestions that I go into debt or try to obtain credit to pay for this work.

I'm not asking for any help, I just want you all to know how FUCKED UP our nation is that when we're more worried about making sure fat-cat asshole CEOs continue making obscene incomes than providing a routine service to someone who desperately needs it and does everything they can to be a productive member of society.",reddit.com
More US citizens have died in the Iraq war than have died from Islamic terrorism on US soil in the past 35 years.,"Here's a right-wing site that has been kind enough to compile a list of all Islamic terrorist attacks on US Soil in the past 30 years:

* 3,309 killed by Muslims in America in 66 terror attacks

Now, of course, they view this as a natural justification for the American crusade against Islam. But let's look at another figure. 

*  Documented civilian deaths from violence: 95,310 – 103,988

But, of course, Iraqis aren't American (or Christian) so their deaths don't matter as much. But let's take this moment just to notice something: Even if you allow that the US actions prevented further attacks, and that those attacks would have happened every year since 2001, amounting to an equal attack each time, you would have had roughly 30,000 American deaths. So we've killed 3 Muslims for every hypothetical American death that probably would not have occurred since 9/11. 

But that's clearly absurd. What we do know is:

* 4375 US citizens have died in Iraq alone.

I go to a Christian college that refers to homosexuality as promiscuity and asks students to refrain from it.,"I go to a Christian College that upon entry requires everyone to sign a ""contract"" saying that we will abide to certain standards and rules.  A lot of these rules are pretty obvious, don't cheat, or don't commit plagiarism.  Also, we get lame puritanical Christian rules like you can't drink, which everyone ignores.  The worst of these rules is concerning something called ""homosexual behavior.""  The direct quote from the statement is ""Scripture also prohibits certain behaviors and community members should avoid them. They include backbiting, cheating, dishonesty, drunkenness, gossip, immodesty of dress, lying, occult practices, profanity, sexual promiscuity (including adultery, homosexual behavior, pre-marital sex), theft, and vulgarity (including crude language).""  I feel that not many of my fellow students really have that kind of view of homosexuality, but for some reason our college administration feels the need to be bigots.  I'm not sure what I can really do about this sort of thing.  As a Christian I feel the need to stand in solidarity with those being oppressed, but I don't know if any amount of solidarity or organization will change this perpetuation of bigotry.  What does reddit think?  Also, blah blah I believe in God blah blah illogical.  That's not what this is about, but if you want to talk about that feel free to send me a message.

I work at a local newspaper. Our editor just got this email from Anonymous.,"Subject: ﻿Greetings Australian Government Officials, Members of Local and International Press, and the General Public. We are Anonymous. Importance: High

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

﻿Greetings Australian Government Officials, Members of Local and International Press, and the General Public. We are Anonymous.

Austrailia - 2/8/2010 - Over the past several years, we have maintained a close watch on the actions of the Australian Government with particular focus on its stance towards internet censorship.

Australia's laws on internet censorship are already among the most restrictive in the western world. Their government filters more internet content than any other Parliamentary Democracy. For some elements within the Government, including Telecommunications Minister Senator Stephen Conroy, this still is not enough. Late in January of 2009 he proposed legislature that would lead to mandatory ISP filtering for all of Australia. The stated goal is to prevent Australia from viewing ""illegal and unwanted content"" on the internet.

Anonymous' concern with this legislature is twofold.

First, the ambiguity of the term ""unwanted content"" is completely unacceptable. No government should have the right to refuse its citizens access to information solely because they perceive it to be ""unwanted."" Indeed, the only possible interpretation of ""unwanted content"" is content that the government itself does not want to be seen.

More importantly, Anonymous does not approve of the steps already undertaken by the Australian Government to control what their populous sees. Claiming to be cracking down on ""simulated child pornography,"" many depictions of women with small breasts in pornography have been banned. Officials cannot claim that they believe the models in these movies are in fact underage, as the production the titles that have been affected are heavily regulated to ensure the age of the models. Instead they are relying on earlier ambiguous wording that allows pornography featuring models that ""appear to be"" under 18 years of age to be treated in the same manner as actual child pornography.

The repercussions of this censorship of a natural body type on the psyche of Australian women cannot be understated, but this is not Anonymous' concern. The Australian Government will learn that one does not mess with our porn. No one messes with our access to perfectly legal (or illegal) content for any reason.

We are Legion. We do not Forgive. We do not Forget

Expect us.

Obama obstructionists reveal themselves for what they are – racist,"As an outsider with a keen interest in U.S. politics it has been apparent for quite some time that the crazy birthers, the truthers, Tea-baggers, the “we want our country back” rednecks, those hoping to twist the 10th amendment completely against the spirit for which it was put in place, the Health Care protesters, Fox News and the rest of the right wing radicals simply cannot handle having a black President.

The latest Fox News spin that Palin wrote what should have been obvious talking points on her hand ( for PREPARED questions) was some kind of clever method of drawing attention to the fact that President Obama (like all World leaders) used a teleprompter is beyond the pale.

Homosexuality in humans is not 100% caused by genetics. Prove me wrong.,"I was recently down voted for pointing this out, followed by posts assuming i was anti-gay.

 To my knowledge there has be no experimental study in humans that demonstrates this effect. There is plenty of correlational studies and animal studies that suggest that genetics play a role in determining sexuality, I do not deny it that, but people seem to ignore how the effects of your environment influence how you think and feel. To to claim that it is purely genetic is not founded in science (its not purely choice or enviromental either).

**I want equal rights for gays** as much as the next hard core liberal, but I don't feel we need to be intellectually dishonest about the science behind it. Besides, the Genetics vs Choice debate, is a farce to start out with. We should be asking people ""So what if i choose to be gay? What right do you have to tell me i can't X Y or Z because of that.""

But on the off chance I am wrong. Bring it.

For example, one time I remember thinking that thunder could be dinosaur footsteps or rain could be someone pouring buckets of water down on the earth. I think it's fascinating how ancient people rejected mystical explanations of nature that involved capricious choices of gods and replaced them with the idea of an orderly and predictable universe that we have today. In some ways, this is like the transition from childhood to adulthood (e.g., no longer being scared of the dark or believing in otherwise childish things).

* My boss calls me long distance at work, midway through the call my phone hangs and refuses to turn on again.
* Had to withdraw money to pay for the car and ended up going to four different ATMs because the ones i went to were either out of order or there was an error on the transaction. 



**TUESDAY**

* Just got my car back and driving into work I nearly get rammed by someone who tried to go straight in a turn right only lane.
* My sunglasses got stolen. My only pair of designer sunglasses, I'm still crying over this one.
* Got a call from my boss that I have two days to prepare a 200-pg presentation for when he comes by for his quarterly review. Nearly a month earlier than usual.
* Driving into the house my mother decides to close the automatic gates a little too fast, resulting in the gate closing into my car. I now also have visible scratches on either side of my car.

"""Black Dynamite""- If you haven't seen it, watch it online, then buy the DVD/BR on Feb. 16th. It is, in my opinion, the funniest movie of 2009 in front of The Hangover","Trailer: 

Red Band Trailer (NSFW): 

You know those movies where the trailer makes the movie look great, then you go to see it only to leave the theater asking why you fell for it again? This is definitely not one of those movies. The film actually manages to surpass the hilarity of the trailer. I hate hyperbole, and this is honestly the funniest movie I have seen in a long ass time. Literally laugh-a-minute. There are so many layers to the comedy: meta, line delivery, the outlandish situations, the fighting etc. It's less of a spoof and more of a love letter imo. And Michael Jai White fucking kills in this role and really flexes his acting muscles by delivering a pretty perfect performance. For this kind of movie to work, there is a fine line between hilarious and stupid, and it surprisingly never crosses into the latter.

The shitty thing is that this movie did not do that well in the box office, and only had a limited release for a short while, so not a lot of people got to see it. Everyone I talked to that has seen it fucking loves it though and we couldn't stop quoting it. I hope it can pull an Austin Powers and blow up when it hits DVD and get the recognition it truly deserves.

"Okay, it's been two days now since I had a submission pass the spam filter of Reddit. And I'm sure as fucking pissed right now as the next guy who posts another one of this bullshit. Come on, Reddit, are you trying to censor me?","Damn. Damn. Damn.

When I lurked Reddit for the past few months, I came across a few posts ranting about this very same thing. I couldn't sympathise with them then because I thought the spam filter was a-okay. Sparklingly clean and perfectly executed. I never realised how wrong I was.
  
Well, so much for the karma-whoring season. I mean, I almost always have 2+ posts appear on the front page simultaneously! Then, I discover that my posts aren't even reaching the *new* tab? WTF, man?

Come on, do I even have to use a bogus account to make a ""mind=blown moments"" post fit through the yoctometer of a needle-hole that is the spam filter? This is not Sparta, this is Reddit!

"I need some help with my sexual relationship with my girlfriend, so I'm turning to Reddit.","So I've seen numerous examples of how Reddit has helped people with their issues and I decided I'd give it a try.

To start off, I'm in a great relationship. We both love to do all of the same stuff except for one thing. Sex. Or anything sexual for that matter. Now I'm not saying that she is never into it but there are issues. 

The first problem is that I have to initiate EVERYTHING. Once things are started it's as if she's all of a sudden interested. I've been with her for more than a year and I can honestly only think of a few times she's sort of surprised me. 

The second issue is that I don't believe she's climaxing, or if she has, it's been very few times. She has been into the sex a few times, since I can tell by her wetness and her cheeks being flush and stuff, but most of the time it seems as if she is just going through the motions. A close friend of mine, who had problems with his gf climaxing as well, described it as a contraction that squeezes you as she is having an orgasm, which I have never felt. With that being said, I try to do everything I can to make her more interested. I try to bring up new ideas and things to try in the bedroom, I make sure that everything feels good to her, I try to find positions that make it more pleasurable to her, and I only concentrate on her while in the act. I would rather her have an orgasm and enjoy the experience than myself if it means we can find something that works for her.

We hang out every weekend, since we go to the same school, and over the past weekend we hung out and went to some parties. Upon getting home, she just said she was tired and went to bed both nights. It wasn't 4am or anything. It was around midnight and she took a nap the one day. So it seems like she purposely said that to get out of having sex or doing anything sexual. The other night I went over to her house and cooked dinner with her. After dinner she suggested we go upstairs and watch a movie. So I figured, oh, maybe she might be up for something. We start the movie and after a bit of talking we started to make out, which usually results in something happening, whether it's sex or something else. After a bit of making out I start to rub and massage her and she stops me and tells me she's not really in the mood because she feels gross. Now this is after we've been making out for a good 15 minutes and I've been kissing her neck and nibbling on her earlobes (which she likes). I'm fairly aroused and when she told me that all of the stuff I did, did nothing for her it made me feel like a piece of shit. Like I could no longer excite her, especially after the past weekend. I was pretty upset. This has been going on for awhile now and I don't know how to deal with it.

So my question to you guys is, am I overreacting? Should I be upset at the fact that we've been together for a year and a half and she's already lost almost all interest in sex? There are only about a few times a month when she's slightly interested, is that normal? She is on birth control, which I've heard could cut down your desire for sex, but I'm not sure if that is the issue. Could that be causing such a disinterest in sex? It just really upsets me that I have to start everything and I feel like I am forcing her, in a way, to go through with it. Not physically forcing her, but she is the kind of person that rarely says no to anyone. She would rather just deal with it then and there rather than say no and have an issue. Should I confront her about this? and my feelings on the issue? Or just suck it up... I feel that the sexual aspect of a relationship is very important to keep the relationship healthy and that aspect of my relationship has been withering away... Help...

EDIT: Thanks for the overwhelming response and the great help. Breakup with her or deal with it. WOW. I'm blow away. Oh and thanks for the two downvotes as well! Those made my day.",reddit.com

"Reddit, please advise me, I don't know what I can do to fix my broken life.","I'm in lots of trouble at the moment, I lost my job due to depression and other illness so I'm out of work at the moment, I have a disability that causes organizational difficulties so it's hard to get anything in my life sorted and I've let everything get out of control.

I didn't realize my car tax had run out, and got pulled over, fined £1000+costs, or they're gonna take my car away, which will severely limit my job options.

I owe lots of various companies money because I kept missing work due to depression/illness and racked up bills I can't pay.

I don't know how I can pay all or any of my debts at the moment, just getting myself signed onto benefits was difficult. I've tried various treatment options for the depression, but none really helped. The organizational difficulties are apparently untreatable. I'm considering filing for a Debt Relief Order, which will wipe away most of the debt, but will not wipe away the court fine, I may be able to get this reduced or canceled if I apply to the court, but thinking about doing that gives me a tight pre-panic attack feeling in my chest.

Relations are good with my lady; it is just I find that I would much rather spend the night chatting over a bottle or two of wine before falling asleep on the sofa than getting carpet burns while making her pant and scream with pleasure.

We’ve gone from once or twice a day at the beginning to I guess once a month or so now, and that is usually on a lazy Saturday morning because we have nothing better to do. This is fine by me, but she is hornier than I am and I think she thinks that I don’t find her attractive any more.

When is suicide justified? ( A cry for help...or just crying because it won't end. ),"1. I have an incurable disease that slowly forces my brain to cannibalize itself. It won't kill me. That would be a kindness. It manifests itself in little ways: I can't organize a room. It's difficult for me to meet your eyes, even for a little bit. It will take me hours to write this post, and the language will still sound unnatural. Real life conversations come more naturally...but are difficult for me emotionally...I'm too afraid of making the mistake that will end them too early. 

2. All my closest friends online, male or female, either used me for sexual release, or were in love with me. I've been unable to make a friend online for any other reason. I'm skilled at cybersex...I approach it as an artform. I'm told I'm skilled at phone sex...

I've always been the one asked to do all this...I never once needed to ask someone else...

Too bad I'm terrified of sex. 

My phobia means nobody feels any guilt about helping me out...so long as we never meet in real life. 

In real life, a man who is scared of sex is useless, and quickly discarded. 

Don't tell me it's not true. 

Nobody will even touch me once they find out.

3. My other talent is therapy. I've stopped suicides, helped people through psychotic episodes...I've even written a local advice column. I know every single reason someone should live...

I just don't see how they apply to me.

My problems won't go away, they aren't short term. As I age, it is likely they will worsen, making me desperate to experience that life has to offer while I still can.

You ever notice how desperation drives people away?

I feel like I'm already dying alone...it's just more prolonged than anyone else will experience.

Please tell me what to do?

Just don't tell me I need therapy...they only listen...and they only tell me how wonderful I am...

No matter how ugly I become...

Should I just become an hero? If so...just tell me how? How do you give up hope things will be better? How do you stop thinking of your friends and family?

This kid in my class at BYU just came out of the closet... here's how he had to do it,"Just so you know, I don't support gay marriage for reasons I won't go into, and this isn't about that. I personally don't have a problem with gay people. 

I walked into my STDEV 110 class today at 11:00 like i always do, and walked through to the back row to where I sit in the class. Throughout the semester I have the oppurtunity to laugh at those who deserve being laughed at without disrupting the class, an activity I really enjoy. But today I witnessed something that opened my eyes a little bit.

There's this kid in my class who I'll call john, and he has always been a little out there. He's goofy in the kind of way girls appreciate and guys hate. One of those best friends with the girls but no guy friends kinda guys. There are lots of mormon kids like that though. 

At BYU you'll get kicked out if you ever do anything homosexual, ever drink, smoke, etc. 99% of everyone is mormon, and they judge you if you're not, or even if you are. BYU is full of self-righteous pricks.

There are gay people at BYU; it's called the drama department, and they keep to themselves. But today John walked into class and said something that really made me hate utah and the whole self-righteous attitude. He said there was this dorm that was especially judgemental, and his group of friends has come up with a good practical joke.

His friends and he were going to spread the rumor that he is gay, and see if the people in said dorm judge him. I didn't really know what to think at first, but I'm pretty sure I've figured it out. It's a cry for help; this kid is alone here. I've tried to project a faux-mitch at BYU, and it is depressing.

Pretending to be something you're not is a highway to depression and self-loathing. You know you're not what these people think you are, and they like you for the fake you; not who you are. I can't imagine how being gay at BYU or in Utah in general would be. Especially moving from somewhere much more accepting to Utah would just be impossible for me.

Do i really live in a place so intolerant of others that someone feels that they have to make a joke of their sexuality in an attempt to find someone else to connect with? This place is messed up.

Dear Reddit: Tired of bad ISP's gouging your wallet? Sick of ISP and Government filtering?

No government would be able to threaten us with any sort of filtering. We wouldn't be under the yoke of companies like Comcast, or AT&amp;T, or Verizon. I think we can do this ourselves.

But how?

In my mind I imagine wifi routers designed to link together. They would sort of create their own carpet of internet access. Each router a person buys would have the responsibility of not only providing access in their home, but also of sharing bandwidth with their neighbors, whose own routers would be doing the same. Given enough people, we could carpet an entire city.

Of course, this all requires a bit of hardware and software. And it may be that there would be better ways of doing it. I don't know. I'm just interested in opening a dialogue to discuss the options.

"I study language for a living and I really couldn't give a shit if you used it correctly. I come to Reddit for insight, not pedantry.","In the words of Michel de Montaigne:

&gt;I was often, when a boy, wonderfully concerned to see, in the Italian farces, a pedant always brought in for the fool of the play, and that the title of Magister was in no greater reverence amongst us; for being delivered up to their tuition, what could I do less than be jealous of their honour and reputation? I sought, indeed, to excuse them by the natural incompatibility betwixt the vulgar sort and men of a finer thread, both in judgement and knowledge, forasmuch as they go a quite contrary way to one another: but in this, the thing I most stumbled at was, that the finest gentlemen were those who most despised them.

Great, you're good at grammar. So am I. Great, it annoys you when you see common mistakes. It annoys me, too. If you really want to ""help"" the person making these mistakes, send them a polite private message. When you publicly reply to them and make a great show about your apparent command of the arbitrary rules of grammar, I dare say that it annoys me more than the original slip-up.

1. What annoys me further are the endless debates around particular grammatical points, usually undecidable, *because language precedes grammar, grammar exists only to help make language uniform*. Many grammatical issues cannot be resolved one way or the other. The so-called ""correct"" use of grammar in English was codified a couple hundred years ago, and it's only by tradition that we choose to follow it. **Grammar is not a science. There is often no ""right"" or ""wrong"" use of grammar.**

2. More important, the uniform application of a single grammatical code *kills dialects and idioms*. Received pronunciation in the UK and so-called ""standard American"" in the US are nothing but social constructs, ways of speaking that attempt to emulate the upper class. If we all followed this, we wouldn't have writers like Faulkner or Mark Twain. *Deviation from ""standard"" grammar contributes to the uniqueness of a regional dialect, idiom, or culture*. The more we punish such deviation, the more we encourage those cultures to disappear. It's a loss for everybody.

In conclusion, please, save the policing of grammar to publishers and journalism schools. I come to Reddit for insight, not pedantry. Pedantry  is useless. 

**Edit:** tl;dr version: I'm a pedantic asshole who thinks very highly of himself, and feel that you would all be honored to know that I think that pedantic grammatical cheap shots actually subvert communication, defeating the purpose that grammar is meant to serve, i.e. the aiding of communication.",reddit.com

How to give a proper handshake.,"This seems to be a lost art, so here are a few pointers I figure I could offer, since I have long been told I have a solid, appropriate, handshakes. While I used the word ""solid"" here , it was in place of the word ""manly"" (rawr), but there is nothing that should be done differently if you're female. It's really not a gender thing.

The point of a handshake is to emphasize a sincere connection to an individual. It is not to stake out your dominance. It is equally wrong to use a handshake as an impromptu brushoff. It's downright criminal to use it to sell a lie.

First, extend your hand at a moderate speed towards the individual whose hand you are shaking. Too slow, and you're going to seem hesitant. Too fast, and you come off as insincere.

Second, grasp the other participant's hand completely (no finger-only grip, please) and firmly in your hand. Too soft, and the entire process is again, subverted. I'm not trying to play slapjack with you, nor am I trying to titillate you, so the feather touch needs to stay at home.

Additionally, applying a concrete crushing vise-grip to my hand will not make me respect your dominance; it will make me despise you and label you a sociopathic assgargler whose new Mercedes in the lot needs a good keying-up. If you think a super-strong grip which causes me pain makes you anything other than a sociopathic assgargler, just don't shake hands anymore. I'd rather be brushed off than injured by you. And no, it wasn't me who keyed up your Mercedes. Probably someone else whose hand you've shaken in the past week.

Now, shake their hand a couple of times vertically, no more than an inch or two in range. Perhaps three times. More than that and you might as well be masturbating, because you're not being sincere, you're just feeling my hand up.

Assuming you're not legally blind, look the person in the eye the whole time. If you're shaking my hand but still reading the appetizer menu, then you aren't being sincere, and since you're treating me as one of ""the help"" anyhow, there's no reason to throw mixed signals my way.

If it's an introductory handshake, then saying my name while you shake my hand, perhaps (but not necessarily) with an added pleasantry, will provide a bit of social lubricant, which will alleviate any potential fears that I may have that you are using the handshake as nothing more than a mechanic for something such as spreading a supervirus which you have smeared on your hand. That, perhaps, or a boogie.

"Reddit, which early 90's mac game am I describing?","I used to play this weird game on a Mac back in the mid/early 90's. I was pretty young then so my memories of the game are possibly very distorted, but here's a bullet list of stuff (I think) I remember:

* It was played on a Mac
* In the same era as ""Shufflepuck Cafe"", ""Scarab of RA"", and ""Spectre""
* The game consisted of a picture for each location where you were... nothing was animated. Though stuff could appear/disappear if you clicked on it.
* I don't remember how you inputted stuff to the game. I think you could click somewhere on the screen (like a door or something) and it would ""enter"" the room by changing the picture. I'm also pretty sure it had a text box where you could type commands, though I never figured out any commands which would work.
* It had sound effects for when stuff in the game happened.
* Pretty sure it was black and white.
* I have no idea what the plot was, but some ""scenes"" from the game I vaguely remember:
* - A bridge with some native american's ass in front of it, and a fart noise from time to time.
* - Entering a church of some sort. There's a pentagram on the floor with some diamond on it. If you take the diamond, a demon comes and it's game over.
* - Some torture room with one of those machines where you spin a wheel and it stretches your arms. The text says: ""The screams of the tortured man still echo"" and you hear reverberating screaming.

If you guys could fill in the blanks, I'll be able to have a nostalgia fest. Thanks!

Am I the only one ridiculously pumped about Google Buzz?,"It's a funny anecdote, but I've honestly not been this amazed or excited by a piece of technology since the SNES. 

I think some people may be snickering about it being some sort of social network status update knock off, but once you've seen the gps integration and how seamlessly Android app integration is, you'll flip out. It's simply brilliant. One touch and you're broadcasting to your whole neighborhood, community, or city. Zoom in and you can see precisely where people are, and using the twitter-like text-only bit to sort buzzes by time, and then check the location of these posts, makes living in a big city feel human again. 

A little part of what I've always dreamed has become true -- imagine wondering ""Where's the train"" or ""Where's the bus"" and being able to flip out your phone, pull up a map, and see exactly where it is. That's power right there. This stuff has the ability to absolutely revolutionize how we visualize (no pun intended) ourselves and those things around us. I was blown away by Google Maps integration in Android, being able to track my location down to rocks and trees I could see from the satellite imagery layer. Now, with how easy it is to update and share GPS and status locations, I think it's going to be a very interesting few years of technology development.",reddit.com
Help! How did you hack your mind to make it do what it's told?,"I am a smart guy, but I have awful study habits. I tend to pick things up quickly and do good work, though it's almost always late and never as good as it could have been.

For more clarification, I am describing something seemingly out of my control that forces me to focus my attention on anything except what I know I need to do. This is best illustrated by something like a mathematics problem set. Instead of doing a problem set, I will instead learn everything about every tangential branch of mathematics on wikipedia, and read three biographies of the most important mathematician involved in the beginnings of the math at hand. I will then design a website about the math, meticulously giving an account of each type of problem in the problem set, it's history, and multiple ways of solving it. But I will never, ever do the actual problems. Make sense?

"Of friends... (A depressed, ranty, advice asking thing)","So I have been thinking about this. And I am growing more depressed by the day. I may not have friends much longer. I have never been good with people. Not since I started school. I didn't make my first friend until 6th grade. (I mean someone who tolerated my presence and seemed to like me). I know a lot of people say they didn't have friends, but I really didn't. 

Well I made a couple of really good friends. But there were side effects. Being my friend meant not really having other friends... I was really, really disliked and being around me meant being shunned. People'd rather cram ten to a (eight person) table than sit with the three of us. They seemed alright with it though. I know my friends are great people but now I am worried. 

I moved away about a year ago and live in town. But I don't really talk to people. I am kind of afraid of people even though I would never admit it aloud. Well, they still live in the country. Soon they plan on moving in with me in town... Once other people see how nice they are, my friends will realize there was way better prospects and leave me. And there are way better people out there. I am a bad person* At our tiny school of 400 there was a limitation on how many people were around. In town, especially going to school, there are way more. Numbers of people that make me sick.

I was alright being alone as a kid before I met them, but now I don't think I could go back to that. I almost wish I hadn't met them. Then I would be like I was as a kid. I was completely alright being alone after about 4th grade.

I know people are going to say ""Well make more friends"" and stuff but I really don't know where to start with that or how it works. It just kind of happened that I picked up the ones I have. I've tried reading up on it but it never seems to work. People seem to get on really well with me for a few months but then they can't stand me. It takes me years to get to know people well enough to trust them. (About 2 years I would say.)

I never intend to date or marry, I just can't see that anyone will ever be able to like me to that extent. And I never expect that I will make new friends. Based on what I know about how my current friends see me, I can only imagine how others see me. One of my friends thinks I am completely without any sort of feelings and comments on it often. Or says things like ""You know, when you embarrass me in public I think it's alright because you have problems."" 

They are really great friends, but if that is what they think about me... after knowing me for seven years.

So how can I keep my friends from talking to other people or leaving me? I don't think I can live without them. Once they are gone I am all alone. 

*When I say I am a bad person I don't mean that I am a mean person... I mean that I lack qualities that makes a person how people are supposed to be. I don't know what qualities, but it is like I am not human at some fundamental level. I am bad at being a person I guess is what I want to say.

So any practical advise is welcome.

TLDR; OP is sad because they can't make friends and might lose their current ones. Making new friends isn't a very good option.",reddit.com

Graphic designers of reddit - help a brother out.,"Hey Reddit, I'll try and keep this as short as I can.

I'm 19, and I'm trying to forge myself a career in graphic design. I should have went to art school to properly study the subject, but unfortunately I chose animation instead, that while will be great skills to have, isn't as enjoyable and interesting, not to mention relevant to my career.

Anyway, I went and showed my portfolio off to a studio and got a good deal of positive feedback. Not in the sense that they were blown away by what I'd done - far from it, but that's exactly what I needed. I've found other people telling me where I'm fucking up (and hey let's face it, I'm doing it a lot) invaluable.

I've been bloody swamped, and I'll admit, lazy (I blame you reddit), so I've not been working on my portfolio. I'd post a link but seeing as I've done nothing new recently, and I consider all the work I've done up until now as sub-par, I won't.

I'm going back to the studio I showed my work off to, among others as soon as I can with a completely revamped portfolio. I've tried to set myself a few projects so hopefully I'll have improved.

**TL;DR Would there be any designers out there that wouldn't mind me getting in contact with them to give me pointers on my work, how to get work in the business (through websites for smaller jobs, or otherwise) and any other tips you might have?**

I promise guys, I won't pester you every second. I realise it's not high on your priority list. :) It would just be great to have someone experienced to talk things out with, and hey, you'll probably like me too. I mean, how can you not? I'm adorable.

2. Filthy communist!
3. Not sure.
Of course they would skew to Filthy communist! Would not that enrage you? That clearly would not represent a fair cross section of America in any way....
Do we really have to organize to mess with results?
Should we not just let the pollsters poll?

Edit: I just want to say that although I disagree with most of the political comments on Reddit most of the time as I am a moderate libertarian, I really love the discussions. I think this time I may have been swayed a bit since online polls are already untrustworthy.",reddit.com
"If you put ""Why all the downvotes"" in your post, I will downvote you.","I'm pretty good about upvoting the comments I like. I upvote anything I feel is well-presented, regardless of if I agree with it or not.

But if you ask about why you're getting downvoted, I will downvote you **regardless** of the content or quality of your post. Here are my speculations on why you're getting downvoted, so you will stop asking:

* **Bots**: Vote-bots target new submissions and downvote everyone. They aren't picking on you in particular. This is why just about every submission remotely near the front page has an upvote score of 60%-80%.

* **People Gaming the System**: People downvote adjacent comments &amp; submissions so their comment will gain more visibility. This is especially apparent on new submissions.

* **Reddit Karma Obfusication**: I don't have the link on hand but I believe the system delays / modifies scores on submissions to fight the upvote / downvote bots.

I invite the hivemind to begin smiting these karma-whores into oblivion. Like the .jpeg photobucket linker, spare no venom against these harlots.

**EDIT: Why all the downvotes? This is a habit that adds nothing to the conversation and is essentially an upvote ploy.**",reddit.com

"""History has thrust upon the leadership of this country the tremendous responsibility to turn our country away from its present direction of conflict and confrontation. Only we, the leaders of our peoples, can do it.""","#**President F.W. de Klerk said this at his inauguration in 1990.**

 
&gt; ""All reasonable people in this country - by far the majority - anxiously await a message of hope. It is our responsibility as leaders in all spheres to provide that message realistically, with courage and conviction. If we fail in that, the ensuing chaos, the demise of stability and progress, will for ever be held against us.

&gt; ""History has thrust upon the leadership of this country the tremendous responsibility to turn our country away from its present direction of conflict and confrontation. Only we, the leaders of our peoples, can do it.

&gt; ""The eyes of responsible governments across the world are focused on us. The hopes of millions of South Africans are centred around us. The future of Southern Africa depends on us. We dare not falter or fail.""
 

---

**On 2 Feb 1990 F.W. De Klerk gave this speech at the opening of South Africa's parliament.**
 
**Among the highlights for the TLDR community include**
 
* the establishment of an outwardly focussed and free market economy
* the recognition and full adoption of the Human Rights model and the release of all political prisoners
* the immediate unbanning of political organizations (including the ANC)
* a respectable compromise on the ""death penalty""
* sound economic strategy detailing controlled and responsible government spending, reduction of inflation and encouraging personal initiative and saving.
* Positive economic outlook (surplus) despite chaotic transitional 'expenses'
* decline debate political motives in favor of the spirit of negotiation and lessons learnt from a global (anonymous) group of advisors
 
He concluded the speech with this:

This is where we stand:
 
 
* Deeply under the impression of our responsibility.
* Humble in the face of the tremendous challenges ahead.
* Determined to move forward in faith and with conviction.

**TEN YEARS LATER**
  
I don't believe this man is given enough credit for the **exceptional** leader he truly was / is. To take responsibility for a generation that has fucked things up and not only pledge ""Change"" but action it with immediate and magnificent efficiency.
 
This man truly paved the way for not only social and economic reform but for healing, reconciliation and future prosperity. He was the architect for the remarkable democratic transition and the establishment of a flagship Constitution. He was a leader and I miss him.

I'm a college student and I work 15 hr/week at an office job here on campus. Today I was at work 9-4:30, doing somewhat menial tasks, thinking about the homework I have to do by tomorrow and not really looking forward to these next few days. I was in a terrible mood by the time I left the office.

When I left work I went to the post office - there was a package waiting for me, from Soapier. ""That's funny,"" I thought. ""I didn't order any soap.""

I eagerly opened the box and found four beautiful bars of Reddit alien soap. I'd been thinking about buying some for a while, but had never gotten around to it. Who would send me this? How did s/he know that I really needed something like this to happen today?

A few weeks ago I became pen pals with  eclipsegum after he requested people ship him books to Malawi. Although he might think mailing me soap was simply a nice gesture, in fact it was so much more than that - he made me really happy after a stretch of bad days. I can't really explain how much this gift means to me coming today.

Since I can't guarantee that there is such a thing as ""real-world karma"", is there any chance that I could ask you to wander over to his post history and upvote it? I promise you that we're two different people (determined souls can comb our post histories and figure that out), I just think it would be a nice gesture.

Am I the only one who actually likes google buzz?,"I use facebook for the following reasons: 

To network with my close group of friends.
To post idiot things that I find on the internet to said friends.
To chat with friends about the idiot things I post.

Now these things are in my gmail. I am actually pretty stoked about that. 

Facebook is only filling a market demand, people want quick easy websites for themselves from which they can communicate with other such sites made by friends - facebook has been dominating this field for a while now by offering a clean and easy interface. 

However facebook has shown at every chance it gets to be more interested in selling our information out for cash than in creating a good product that people want to use. facebook has gotten really bloaty, verging on being a web-based version of any hideous bloat-ware a la 2003. 

I don't care if google is an ""ad platform"", their ads don't intrude into my browsing and are never as annoying as the targeted adds on facebook, which constantly remind me that I am 31.

Finally, most of the anti-buzz buzz seems to be about how evil it was of google to assume you might want to talk to the people you email, and how evil it was of them to publish this list on your profile. First, your profile is not publicly searchable unless you fill in certain amount of information, during which time you are offered the option to *not show your contacts list*. Furthermore, if one had taken time in the past to clean up their contacts list, they would have had absolutely zero problems.

I can agree that google should offer easier opting out of certain parts of buzz, but in all seriousness most of the people freaking out about it have not taken the time to play with the settings. 

TL;DR: if you don't like buzz, fine, but most issues with it are user error.",reddit.com

Reddit has ceased to be a site about news and has morphed into a pit of far left hypocrites who belittle anyone with even a slightly differing opinion and stupid pictures of babies in gnarwhal(sp?) outfits.,"I have been coming to Reddit for the last year, shorter than most people and I found that in one short year this website has changed from an unbiased depository of informative news articles relating to everything to nothing more than a garbage dump of stupid pictures of people with giant cardboard box towers they built for their cats and gnarwahl(sp?) suits they made for their kids.

My favorite aspect of this site used to be the fact that their were always dozens of articles exposing the genocide that Israeli's were committing against Palestinians but within a month, all of these articles were mysteriously down voted en masse by some mysterious entity despite being very popular. Everything else good disappeared around this time as well but this is what I specifically noticed and than this site just turned into a den of extremely biased democrats who would whine about Christians, that horrible cocksucking God of theirs, how Christians rag on other peoples beliefs! (Irony much!?) and how LSD makes you smarter (the equally unfounded idea that LSD causes brain damage was less unnerving than the shit ""redditors"" have schemed up in their LSD ridden brains). 

this stage was fleeting however and soon replaced with the giant compost heap we now see, now this place has become the New Jersey of websites... yeah, that's right, the New motherfucking Jersey of motherfucking websites, the worst state ever, a floating barge of human and material filth!

Public Service Announcement: How to make snow ice cream,"Where I live in Texas we don't get a good snow very often these days, maybe once a decade if that. When we do, we make snow ice cream, or at least my family does. I mentioned this in an earlier thread and people had never heard about it, so I'll go over it again. And I like to keep things simple, so this is not going to be some kind of über-gourmet best snow ice cream evar kind of thing.

Go out and get nice fluffy snow in a mixing bowl, then add two or three tablespoons of sugar, a teaspoon or so of vanilla extract, and then keep adding milk and stirring until it has it has a pleasant consistency. It melts fast so you'll be tempted to eat it quickly, then you'll get brain freeze, so be careful.

And that's it. The vanilla extract is pretty important, and it takes less sugar and more milk than you might think at first.

It must have snowed more often when I was a kid, because I think I remember one year there was a cautionary item on the news about how it wasn't a good idea to eat snow since it would pick up Strontium-90 from above ground nuclear testing, but by that time I had already eaten it many times, so I figured it was too late for me.

I do remember some years when we had to be very careful in gathering the snow, because if we scraped too deep we might get dirt or grass in it, depending on where we got it from. It's best to use some kind of wide cooking utensil to scrape it up, so you just get the topmost layer.",reddit.com

To contact her or not to contact her...  (and what to say),"So I met a girl at a party about a month ago, we really seemed to hit it off.  She ended up asking for my phone number, and I got hers as well. The only problem is, she lives about 300 miles south of me, and was only in town that weekend visiting a friend. 

So after she left town the next day, we texted back and forth a bit. I sent one text to her that she didn't respond to for 3 days, and when she finally did we texted back and forth a couple more times, ending with me asking her to give me a call/text next time she comes to town. She responded with ""for sure.""

Weekend after that I texted her and it went pretty well, a bit flirty, pretty good, some nice banter.  I asked if she was coming up again anytime soon, she said probably not, since her friend and her had a fight.

Since then, we've had no contact. She's come into my mind a bit lately, and I want to text her hi or something, ask how she's doing, but I'm not sure what to say. I think a call would be too much, since we only knew eachother for about 5 hours, and its been a month since even a text.  I'm worried about the proximity to valentines day, she might think its weird.  Also, I don't know her situation at all, as to whether she has a boyfriend now, or anything else, etc.  

So, what would you all suggest I do? Contact her, not contact her? If I do, what do I say?

I know I'm gonna get answers to check her facebook, but she's the one girl on earth without one, haha. Figured I'd head that one off.

I was in a coma for two weeks, lost 30 pounds, and was on a breathing/feeding tube for over a month. I got out, volunteered in the community, interned at a councilman's office, then got hired. Prior to finding out my status, I started a charity upon returning from my post-graduation trip to Africa. Had no idea I would be the one in need that following year.

Strangely however, had it not been for my illness I would not be in the position I am today.

Mandatory changing of passwords forces me to write it down!,"Is anyone as incensed about this as I am?  I can't stand being forced to change my passwords.  I was recently at university for 3 years and every 3 months I had to change my password to something that hadn't been used before.

My standard password has capitals, numbers and symbols which I use for everything and can store in my head, I could only use this password for the first 3 months.  Then I had to change it, bugger if i'm going to be able to remember another complex password, so I had to start using simple passwords.  Even then I had trouble remembering so I had to do the biggest security no-no of all, write the password down.

Why can't you just leave me to my chosen password!

P.S I realise the silliness is using one password for everything but I figure have a single complex password is better than having a load of weak ones I can keep in my head.  Let me know if i'm wrong.",reddit.com

"As a Canadian, I am embarrassed by the Opening Ceremony for the 2010 Vancouver Olympics.","**FINAL EDIT** -- To be honest, I'm not sure what I was expecting from the Opening Ceremony, and may have pre-empted this post. I, however, stand by my view that such a minority was given was seemed to be the lion's share of the opening, that being the Aboriginal Peoples.

However, the greatest disappointment was the fact that our HYDRAULIC systems didn't work correctly, and only 3 of 4 ""arms"" raised out of the ground, spurring a 5 minute delay to the lighting of the torch. Coupled with the fact that both the indoor, and outdoor torches were identical, and lit very ""Anti-climactically"" makes me feel, well, yeah, embarrassed to call this my country's Olympic games.

---- Original Post ----

Nothing about this opening ceremony (To be fair, ""so far"") is memorable. I feel as though those who don't know much about Canada will believe we all wear Aboriginal head-dresses and dance and speak various aboriginal languages, when this simply isn't the case. Especially considering I've met people who legitimately believe most Canadians live in Igloos.

I'm disappointed that during the Nelly Furtado performance (Which was entirely lip-synched) there were absolutely no ""ooh"" or ""aah"" moments, no visual effects or anything to make you want to say ""Hey, that was really cool.""

Think back to the Beijing Olympics just a few years ago, I remember their crazy modulated floor system, and their (although CGI) footstep-fireworks, crazy acrobatics, and the whole she-bang. What do we have? A circle with four posts.

It's not often that Canada hosts a Winter Olympics, let alone any Olympics, and I'm utterly disappointed in the quality (or lack thereof) of our Opening Ceremony. Anybody else agree?

EDIT.1: Now we're on to trees and very plain dancing. More lipsynching. Come on Canada, make me proud :( Hell, our Prime Minister wasn't even waving a flag...

EDIT.2: I just feel as though if you're going to have visuals, make them interesting, not confusing. Case in point: Satan in a Canoe.

EDIT.3: Very thankfully, I'm beginning to eat my words. :) That segment was amazing, and quite beautiful. :) Very good image of Canada in my opinion. Keep it coming! :D

EDIT.4: The Opening Ceremony should have begun with the mountain thing. Plain and Simple. Such large focus shouldn't have been given (in this redditors opinion) to such a small minority of our people, the aboriginals. Even the poem was quite nice. :)

While I'm not ""embarrassed"" by this point, I'm still most certainly not ""impressed"" either... :(",reddit.com

"Not seeking medical advice, but a rant","In high school I had a pilonidal cyst (google image search = NSFW, pretty graphic). After going through four doctors who had no idea what it was, I finally had surgery, and that was it. Took forever to heal but at least it was done.

Nope! Fast forward to June 2009. Almost overnight I get another one. I go to the doc and he gives me Percocet and two really intense antibiotics (Levaquin, metronidazole). Even with the drugs working full bore, this was the most pain I've ever been in. I wasn't able to get surgery until September 2nd. No, THAT was the most pain I've ever been in. I spent 3-4 weeks almost completely immobilized. My surgeon (who also operated the first time) said it was healing properly in October. Sweet!

But it seems to be back AGAIN. Coincidentally, the area immediately around where the surgery took place is completely numb and paralyzed, so I'm not in as much pain as I really could be. Probably won't be able to see the doc for about a month.

Fuck this! I'm going back to the previous surgeon but will be seeking second opinions and x-rays. No, he didn't take xrays before. I don't know if they'd help but it didn't occur to me until today that it seems weird.

Canada's opening was AWESOME - Too bad NBC didn't let us see it,"So my fiance and I are watching the opening ceremony last night.  I got home just before the US walked out so I figured I'd stay for the show part of the event.  

The Canadians clearly put a HUGE amount of effort into creating a stadium sized show that would blow your mind.  One event had what looked like a thousand people dancing around.  Another had a guy suspended on a harness doing amazing things.  In every show the floor, and different pieces brought up from it, served as integral backdrops.  Too bad NBC didn't let you see most of that shit.  Instead of the grand show, the whole enchilada, the choreographed masterpiece, we got see a fucking face.

I'm going to use the harness guy as an example.  A lot of effort was put into giving the illusion he is flying over a changing landscape symbolizing the majesty of Canada's vast wilderness.  What does NBC show us?  They go back and forth between a shot of he against the FUCKING CEILING (the one part of the stadium not used in the show), his face (Yes, we know he has a face, thank you) and a close up of him in a harness.  Yes, I am sure its a cool harness.  I am also sure the folks who created the incredible show wanted us to see the whole thing, not the goddamn harness.

I say this because I almost left at one point because I thought the show was pretty strange and boring.  Then NBC very briefly showed the camera shot they should have used the entire time and I was able to see the entire show in all its glory.  The hundreds of people dancing around while the light show created an effect that made me understand how awesome it must be to see it live.  For that brief moment I appreciated just how much went into the ceremony.  Then they zoomed in on a fucking face.  

Edit:  To clarify a bit.  I am not talking about the athletes entrance.  I am speaking only of the show after.",reddit.com

"Genius idea to control population control, or huge fail?","**TLDR: 10,000 dollars for self-sterilization (removal from the gene pool).**

Thinking about how most government programs reward people who have kids already and neglect people who choose not to have kids (not implying everyone who has a kid does so irresponsibly), I tried to think of a program that rewards people for not adding to a potential population issue, or just choosing not to have kids.

Thus I present ""Revenue for Removal (from the gene pool)."" You elect to have a sterilization procedure done and are paid 10,000 dollars for your decision.  The program would have a minimum and maximum age, and stipulations.  You do not qualify if you are already sterile, no participants under an age limit, etc.

The cons I've foreseen; could be seen as targeting lower income or less well-to-do segments of society. To be frank, I think it is. In that light it could be seen as a form of Eugenics or something, despite it being open to everyone. Naturally those who value their ability to potentially reproduce over 10g's would be less inclined while those who do not think of long term consequences as much would be more inclined.

The pro's: A form of economical stimulation and way to reward people who want to responsibly remove themselves from the gene pool. I don't know the logistics of WIC, Welfare, adoption agencies, etc, but perhaps may be a cheaper alternative for the government to supporting low-income children.

Please keep responses constructive.

Edit: It isn't so much intended as an ""Overpopulation control"" issue, but a reward for those who choose not to have children. You could say not having kids is it's own reward, or that it is not reward worthy, or that rewards for those who have kids should be rewarded less, etc.",reddit.com

"For the last two months I've been purchasing new electronics, books, games, hardware, bikes, keeping them until I'm bored, then returning them for refunds.","**tl;dr: Exploit stores for free shit by returning it later.**

It started when I purchased a $10 USD digital watch at Walmart. I absolutely destroyed it during the attempt to severe it from its indestructible packaging, returned it immediately, and bought another watch. The cheap piece of plastic didn't even fair as well as its predecisior. I returned it right after the other one, expecting the Spanish Inquisition, but...nothing.

Next I purchased the more recent Twilight installment (hahaha... rip me if you want, you have no idea how many girls want to speak with you if you're reading one), and when I finished, I wondered... Would they question if I returned a book, when one could obviously read it and then return it? They didn't.

My initial thought was *Sweet, free books; I can read whatever I want   and simply return it. Rinse and repeat*; however, the true potential hadn't yet donned on me.

Despite Walmart policies, its apathetic and depressed employees couldn't care less what you return, nor what condition its in. I purchased Fable 2 (I know, old, but poor people have a bit of a lag when buying games (their cheaper after a while)) and finished the campaign in a day. After realizing it had no other redeemable qualities (no multilayer or co-operative mode), I was pissed that I wasted my money. I returned it. The policy is that games, computer software, CDs, DVDs must be returned unopened (for obvious reasons, you pirates you) but if you have a decent excuse, they really don't care. Actually, 99% of the time they just return it anyways. However, I volunteered one: my grandmother bought it for my birthday, but it's not the one I asked for. They gave me cash, and I bought another game.

I've been doing more or less the same, but here are some of the more interesting items I've returned (varies stores, not just Walmart)

* A HUMONGOUS frog stuffed animal (for the lulz)
* Several different HD TVs
* A PS3 (""I asked for a 360"")
* Countless Books
* Tons of movies I couldn't find a torrents for (yeah, I ripped them)
* Computer software + Games
* Xbox 360 Games
* Wireless Routers (I was seeing how much I could boost my signal)
* Dozens of different bikes
* Clothing (I more or less wear new attire every day)
* Shoes
* Jewelry (vainity?)
* Desktops, Blueray burners, LCD monitors

I know how to solve America's obesity problem.,"This weekend, after purchasing a tiny yogurt for the ridiculous price of $4, I became indignant. Why is a healthy, 80-calorie treat four times as expensive as fattening potato chips? Why should I be punished for making a good decision? And then it came to me: 

*We should charge by the number of calories.*

Not a penny per calorie, but more on a scale of healthiness. If the price of food reflected the price to your health, we would all make better decisions, no?

Is this in any way viable? Does it consider the costs of production or shipping or any other realistic business model? HELL NO, but imagine how thin we would be if the price of celery was ""We pay *you* 89 cents!""",reddit.com

She comes back in, FREAKED OUT, saying there is a truck with blood on it. We all kind of wonder what the hell is going on, so we check it out. It is in fact covered in blood. So we decide to look in the bed, where a chainsaw and 2 large plastic bags are covered in blood. Shapes of meat/flesh were sticking out. There's also a rotweiler inside the truck. We were freaked the fuck out. Someone died down the street last weekend...

We call the cops and they check it out. After a few tense moments, the cop comes over and tells us that the bags are full of pig/boar organs. It was a hunters truck, and he butchered the animal with the chainsaw, apparently. Who would park this vehicle in front of a park in a neighborhood?

"Tonight was the last straw, I'll never watch a movie in a theater again.","Decided to watch a movie tonight and halfway through some thugish looking guys sneak in and sit right next to me.  They proceed to talk and use their cell phones which is totally annoying.  I got pissed off, walked out and told the manager about the stupid fucks.  He was nice about it and got Security to kick them out.  

So I end up missing a big chunk of the movie, luckily the manager puts me in another room where the same movie is just starting.  Ten minutes into the screening a group of adults/kids directly behind me start talking at full volume and cracking jokes.  I kindly tell them to quiet down and they laugh at me.  At this point it's late and I'm exhausted, so I just give up and ask the manager for a refund. 

I've had issues with people talking in the past, I've screamed at kids and gotten into arguments with old ladies but I never had a night like this.  WTF is wrong with people, they are either insane or just really stupid, when did this become ok, am I crazy for wanting quiet when I pay 11 dollars for a movie?  

Is Eugenics the answer, would eliminating all people with an IQ of under 110 solve this problem or should theaters bring back ushers?

What's so bad about literacy tests?,"I know that historically our government abused the concept of a literacy test to prevent blacks from voting.  However, it was only racist because it was selectively applied.  If everyone had to take and pass an objective literacy test before being allowed to vote - I think that would be a great thing and I think it would vastly improve the quality of elections in this country.

Certainly it would be difficult to craft general political questions - but at the very least I think it would be wise to quiz people on the major positions that the candidate they are voting for holds, and if they do not know them to at least some extent, discard their vote.  If someone doesn't even know what they're voting for then surely there is no reason to count their opinion.

EDIT: Let me make one thing clear here that I think may be tripping people up, logically.  I am not suggesting that we secretly enact these tests, or that we make them extremely difficult - or that we make them English only, or anything like that.  The public would be informed of the presence of the tests beforehand, probably even informed of what the exact questions would be.  So what i'm actually suggesting is not preventing anyone from voting who truly wants to, but simply putting an extremely trivially surmountable impediment in there way that will vastly improve their ability to make up their own mind in a meaningful manner.  All I am suggesting be required is that they *know* the truth about the candidates, they can still choose to vote in whatever manner and on whatever basis they like.  I am by no means suggesting that you be made to justify your vote.  The knowledge required to pass the type of test I am envisioning would be pieces of information that could be quickly and easily acquired by anyone.  In fact, I don't think there would be anything wrong with posting up the questions AND answers beforehand on a government website.  The purpose here isn't to prevent the stupid from voting - it is to force the ignorant to educate themselves before making up their mind.",reddit.com

"Hi bad spellers of reddit, here is a quick protip to help your spelling...","**tl;dr:** See the last paragraph.

I'm not one of the spelling &amp; grammar Nazis who gets pissy every time I see a spelling error, but many of them cause me to die a little inside. Errors like 'definately' (hint: the spelling is similar to that of 'infinitely') or the constant abuse of you're/your. But this is about spelling.

Lots of people are crap spellers. I've got at least one friend who is otherwise very intelligent, but sucks at spelling, so I don't get upset about it, however at the same time it looks very amateurish to spell badly, and doesn't help you in a conversation or argument if you're trying to engender respect.

**See the search bar in your browser?** Set it to Google (like you haven't already), and every time you're not sure how to spell a word, type **define:*word***, where 'word' is the word you wish to check. If you've misspelled it, Google will almost always suggest the correct spelling to you. It's also a great way to quickly check the definition of a word.",reddit.com

Dear Reddit: I was broken up with today... on Valentine's Day...,"...by a woman I've been with for nearly four years... through an email. She ended it with ""I will not contact you.""

Gee, thanks.

But you know what? I'm fine. Hurt and lonely, and of course a little depressed... but still breathing, still browsing Reddit, and still enjoying the purr of my little kitten right beside me on my desk. I'm going to be okay.

And so are you.

I don't mean to stereotype, but I have no doubt that many of our users are single... I just hope not too many others joined the bachelor/ bachelorette ranks today the way I did. 

Either way, it's of no matter... I love all of you. 

Not in the bottled-up-and-labeled, commercialized, cinematic sense of the word... but in the way that matters. I love you just the way you are, because we're all tied to the same wheel as it goes round and round. Because of this little site and a little white alien, we've been able to claim a spoke of that wheel as our own, a place where we can share pains and triumphs, advice and experiences, knowledge and humor. We have the unique ability to claim membership in not just a community of our own, but in a community which proves on a weekly and daily basis to be the most giving, loving Internet community going.

I don't know about you, but I'm proud of that.

So, consider this your valentine, Reddit... from a man who's managing to smile despite having a woman he loves leave him on the worst day imaginable, in very nearly the most cold and heartless manner imaginable. I've got Billie Holiday on the stereo, a beer in my hand, and a cute kitten who doesn't even know how to send email. Best of all, though, I've got you, Reddit... and you've got me. Right now, that's enough.

Happy Valentine's day.

NBC is ashamed of k.d. lang.,"I just downloaded a torrent of the Olympic opening ceremonies because I wanted to re-watch k.d. lang's amazing rendition of ""Hallelujah"".

As I watched the NBC version of the same performance, I found myself underwhelmed. I realized it was because NBC showed almost no close ups of her performance. Instead it was comprised of 98% long shots and crowd reactions. Meanwhile, the cutie who sang the national anthem received plenty of close-up camera attention. I can only conclude that k.d. is a little too lesbian for general American consumption and therefore it was decided not to spend too much time on her ""non-traditional"" looks.

I didn't add myself to this group, having had absolutely no reason to.

Today I learned that all of my contacts had been invited by me to the same group. All I can imagine is that they're using some kind of exploit in facebook to automatically sign users up to the group and send out invites. There are a few more things which led me to believe this:

- The group appears to only be a few days old; the link to zml was only posted yesterday, yet the group already has 20,000 members and counting

- There's a comment on the wall from another user, confirming that it is sending out invites without consent.

Here's a little mathematical formula that might help you answer these questions: 

If: 
A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z 

Is represented as: 
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26. 

Then: 

H-A-R-D-W-O-R-K 
8+1+18+4+23+15+18+11 = 98%  

And 

K-N-O-W-L-E-D-G-E 
11+14+15+23+12+5+4+7+5 = 96% 

But ,  

A-T-T-I-T-U-D-E 
1+20+20+9+20+21+4+5 = 100% 

And,  

B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T  
2+21+12+12+19+8+9+20 = 103% 

AND, look how far ass kissing will take you. 

A-S-S-K-I-S-S-I-N-G  
1+19+19+11+9+19+19+9+14+7 = 118% 

So, one can conclude with mathematical certainty, that While Hard work  and  Knowledge will get you close, and Attitude  will get you there, its the Bullshit   and Ass kissing  that will put you over the top.

"Ok Reddit, with the exception of bill collectors, when someone calls and you want them to stop, the correct phrase is ""Take me off your list!""...you can add a 'please', if you want....","I work for a University, in enrollment, and I spend the day calling people who sign up to request information on getting their degree online. The problem is, lots of these people do this because they might make a little money requesting information for those online deals. I have no problem with that.   
My issue comes into play when I call somebody to answer questions or give information, and they yell at me, or hang up on me. Look, it's no skin off of my back, but I am not a telemarketer. These folks purposefully entered their email address and phone into a form online that clearly states ""contact me"".    
I get it that some people don't really want info on school. Thats fine.  Just say ""Take me off of your list."" when somebody calls. I spend all day scrubbing lists, trying to coach people without being obvious (Sorry folks, ALL universities are basically in it for the money, and being obvious gets me in trouble), and still, day in and day out, people let it get to them.   
   So look, fill out the forms, do the thing, try and get paid by doing the trial things, I get it. But don't get mad at me when I call, and don't get mad when you say ""stop calling!"" and then hang up and get called again. I know it seems obvious, but there is actually a specific set of laws governing this stuff. 'Stop calling!"" could mean many things. Like ""Stop calling me...today..."". And yes, in real life, people say that, and then sign up for school two weeks later.   
   Me, I say stop calling, I mean FOREVER. So I understand where you are coming from, here. But the world is full of different perspectives and alien situations...and they try to make these rules in a way that accommodates that. which, unfortunately, means it can be interpreted many ways.   
   You don't want this. You want to be specific. The specific law is ""Take me off your list."" You say this, and they call you back again? You get up to $500 in some cases, and the business gets fined $5k.   
   I don't like calling people who hate to be called. if I did, I'd go work for AOL again. My job is to get people into school who are afraid they can't get in, or just want to go back, and don't have time to go to a campus. Not to bug you, and not to get yelled at or hung up on. Help us both out...say ""Take me off your list."" And spend all that time you were being angry at the blank face on the phone... eating bacon, or watching narwhal documentaries, or waiting for the second Tron movie to come out, or Diablo 2, like me.

I work at a restaurant; a guy asked us how to propose and he leaves an 8.3% tip.,"I am a manager at a large casual dining chain restaurant and worked a very busy shift today (Valentine's Day). Normally, people do not propose at our establishment. This evening, while one man was on his way to the restroom he ""pst pst'd"" his waitress from the kitchen entrance and asked her to give them a cake for dessert with a note inside asking the girl he is with to marry him.

The server came up to me and asked what to do and how to go about it. Our main dessert, the cake he asked for, has a warm liquid center and is topped with ice cream. We couldn't put a note in it. So we racked our brains and came up with an idea. 

We took a plastic heart shaped ring from cupcakes the staff had earlier and pink paper precut into a flower shape that we found. We wrote the message on the note and and rolled it inside. 

We put this prettily on the plate and served the dessert. 

The woman opened the note and was surprised and cried and said yes.  She joked with him about it being a plastic ring before he gave her the real one. They seemed so happy. 

This guy came in with no plan and we made it quite special. Then the asshole didn't say thank you and left $5 on a $60 check. Thanks buddy.

Number 3: A draft will please the Christian right because this will create a deterrent to homosexuality since people are afraid to fight in war.

Number 4: This will help stop homophobia because those so called ""sinners"" will be on the front lines protecting our freedoms.

Number 5: There are tons of gay people in the military already, the navy especially. Everyone knows it. C'mon people, you knew that.

I'm an over-achiever about to go under,"So all my life I've been the 'A' student, going the extra mile and all that crap.  It's my senior year in my Mechanical Engineering degree program and because I've worked my butt off I only need 3 classes this semester to graduate.  However, being the over achiever that I am I decided to load up on 2 grad classes and a research project.

One of the graduate level courses (Fundamentals of Ceramics) is proving to be a lot more difficult than I anticipated.  The assigned bookwork asks questions which aren't covered in the book.  The teacher is worthless when it comes to answering questions.  His lectures consist of literally reading the textbook to us; whenever we ask him a question he scans the book and tells us he'll get back to us later (he doesn't).

This class takes up a huge chunk of my time and is making me miserable.  I don't need it to graduate, but taking this class would put me farther along my master's degree program.  After graduation I'm going to start working for the Navy for two years and then I'm going to come back and finish my Master's degree.

So my question to you fellow redditors:  Should I listen to my over achiever persona and stick this class out, or should I give my prof the finger and re-take the class at a later date?

Climate change seems watered down as a term. Society is always telling us that we need to be more accepting of change, because change is inevitable. Resigned worry and hand-wringing seems like the appropriate response to this term.

Climate destabilization, however, seems to be a more accurate depiction of localized weather phenomena, which are what people seem to get most concerned about. Plus the urgency of the term is befitting of the actual circumstances.

"Is healthcare a right, or a privilege?","Is healthcare a right, or a privilege? When I pose this question to teabaggers, they always exclaim ""it is a privilege""! When I ask them how one would merit this privilege (I have to explain this concept to them using very simple analogies, such as driving) they always hit on the idea of ability to pay. But this has gotten me thinking. If healthcare really is a privilege that must be merited (as a free market commodity), then shouldn't the provider be able to decide the criteria for merit? Why should an emergency room physician who doesn't think that a teabagger like Rush Limbaugh merits treatment and stabilization for a heart attack be forced by law to render him their services, even if he has money out the wazoo to pay?

"Dear reddit, I have had two abortions and thought about killing myself. I now want to talk about it.","The first time I was 19. It was the second time I had sex. I was dating a wonderful guy and he was the only one I had slept with. We were incredibly stupid and thought he could ""pull out"".
We were scared so we got a morning after pill. It didn't work. A few weeks later I was found out I was pregnant. I don't really remember my conversation with the doctor but she seemed very nice about it. She handed me a few pamphlets about my options and told me ""it happens to 40% of women"".
We found a clinic and I had to go in for ""counseling"" before they would let me have the procedure. I don't remember the whole event except these details -
they called my name in the waiting room... I squeezed his hand and walked in... i had to put on a robe and i remember looking at the other women and wondering what stupid thing they had done... some of them were there with their mothers and i felt so sad. the doctor walked in as I was passing out from the anesthesia and I remember thinking ""oh no he will be so disappointed in me (I am Indian as was he)"".
I went through a horrible depression afterwards. I came pretty close to ending my own life. The methods I wanted to use were cutting or jumping - seemed the least painful. I withdrew from everyone I knew. I continued to study and work, almost obsessively. I lost 20 lbs and went from 110lbs to 90lbs.

The second time was with my same boyfriend (I know... how stupid can TWO people get). I was 23. We didn't use protection in the heat of the moment. I thought I was pregnant but he adamantly dismissed it as paranoia. ""We can't be THAT unlucky!""
But unfortunately we were. Three pregnancy tests came up as positive. We went to a doctor and she confirmed it. I had a hard time finding a clinic that did not require an overnight stay (different state). The first time we scheduled the procedure they said they couldn't do it  because I was too early in the pregnancy. The next date was 3 weeks out. I was alone for those three weeks and I continually thought of ending my life, but the only thing that held me back was ""what would my parents think of me!""

By the time I finally had the procedure I was starting to get morning sickness. I don't remember much of the days intervening. All I know is that I fought a lot with my boyfriend (who was in another state and wouldn't move to be with me) and didn't eat much.
The procedure didn't go well. My boyfriend held my hand through the whole thing. I was back in the room in 3 weeks because they ""some of the fetus remained"".

So there it is.
I have had two abortions and I am only 25. My boyfriend is now my ex, and I feel ready to talk about it. But for the last six years I have pulled away from family and friends, have not built any strong relationships, and cannot understand how I will ever break the news to any man I date or marry. I am Indian, my boyfriend was not. This just complicated everything even more. I am totally screwed up about sex, and keep imagining the day I get pregnant again.

Adopting a new sense of our society?,"As many of you can relate, I have a higher than normal IQ.  Growing up, I always knew I was different and one day I finally put my finger on it.  The reason me and friends were/are outcasts was because everyone else was/is practically braindead.  

This of course continued to infiltrate my view of existance into college when I couldn't believe the individuals that were accepted, nay even paid to attend university.  I kid you not, they are no different than Palin in their incapability to distinguish minute facts with unreality presented to them by media.  I wish I had examples but just thinking about it pisses me off and it is redundant because I know many of you have experienced what I have.

Proliferation continued as I interacted with others in the ""real world"" and realized college today is fake.  It makes an attempt to differ the world through youth but for most it is a daycare, or a place to go to get a job and even then you get the job and realize your money was wasted because they treat you like a robot anyway.

Most people on this site ( I know I am new) seem to agree.  This leaves us to not interact with society and stay at home.  Great!  That saves money and stupidity from taking your brain, but it makes it hard to meet women/men, develop societal graces, etc.  Then we realize the internet.  But the interconnect can distort reality and is a whole different communication process.  

I propose this.  People of reddit meet other redditors.  Make dates as groups or individually as friends and/or more.  Let us go out and show that our society isn't perpetually stupid.  Make a new status quo by going out in storm and being intelligent, savvy, and overall the salt of the earth.  By dismissing those who make fun of us, maybe we can make a difference.   Slowly, maybe we can elevate overall intelligence.  

Dumb people have taken over our society and leading it into the trash.  While you can say ""Fine, doesn't effect me"", realize there is a compactor that will crush your existance.  Trust me, these people are animals.  Look what they did to ""terrorists"".  Habeas Corpus is still amended to not exist last I checked.  Police can arrest without probable cost and who's to say your not a terrorist with that beard/cigarette/beer/joint/shoes/glasses?  You have all felt some sort of minute persecution by individuals who grew up and now run the country. 

Worst comes to worse, you meet some potential lifelong friends unlike you have ever had, because we are a minority and are not easy to find.

"Hi reddit.  I've been rejected by a large number of medical schools and am depressed.  Help a friend out, please?","Hi there reddit.  

I've been rejected by 20+ medical schools due in part to my procrastination in sending out applications and also due to my mediocrity as a student/average GPA.  I used to be smart-I had a near-perfect SAT score, but now I feel dumb.  I am getting 70's in biochemistry.  My friends are getting 80s-90s.  I did get a mid-30s score on my MCAT, but there's no way that wasn't luck.   I could possibly get accepted to one school, but it'll be thousands of miles away from my fiancee and would be full of students that I've seen hundreds of times before in undergrad.  I hate most of them and their cocky attitudes.  I've started thinking maybe I'm not cut out for medicine.  I enjoy the arts much more than sciences, and generally perform far better in them.  Maybe law school or a MPH would be better?  Has anyone else switched from medicine to anything else?

Additionally, I can't ever focus on anything anymore.  My mother is a pharmacist who fears giving her children adderall or ritalin.  I was wondering if anyone else on here was feeling depressed because of their lack of motivation or failures, then took something to make it better?  I'm not a pill-fix guy, but something feels very wrong.  Couple this with repeated failure and a quarter-life crisis, and it's a recipe for mental disaster.

"I can't stand this ""America sucks and Americans are so stupid"" mentality from my fellow Americans","It is not constructive. I know alot of things are bad in America or even fucked up. But USA is not nearly as bad as everyone is making it out to be. I truly believe USA is one of the greatest countries in the world. And before anyone else think's I am defending the 'rhetoric' like one poster said, and I am just making excuses for our government and just saying oh well; I am not.  

I am constantly thinking of ways to fix our country, but waiting until I am more educated until I put myself out there(only 21 and still in the military). I even came up with the idea a few days ago about start teaching our children in schools on how to farm and use the yields as food in the cafeteria. Although its been thought of already probably way before me, I'm thinking of ideas, not just saying fuck it.

I will be the first to admit I haven't really traveled the world alot so I don't have as worldly view as some people.  But I have been in Korea for almost 3 years and have met alot of foreigners in Korea. And most if not all of them had said yeah, we really dislike what your government has done, but it is still one of the best countries in the world.

One of them I have met was an Iraqi who escaped from being drafted into guerrilla war-fare into Europe when he was around 12 years old.  He traveled all over Europe and lived from home to home until he was around 17~20 years old and came to United States. He has since been working in the US for almost 20 years while working in different countries for 1~2 year stints(most of them 3rd world countries).  He is by no means ignorant, and is a giant history buff. And he also creates scripts for big hollywood movies.

I used to be militant about how bad our country was until I actually talked to him about it.  He actually started crying to me about how we have no idea how great we have it in the USA.  After hearing him talk, I started to realize how kick ass our country is and how proud I am of being American, and I believe anyone else would.

I think the main problem of America as a whole is that everyone expects everything to be fixed immediately. And it just doesn't work that way. There are so many issues intertwined with each other that its almost impossible to fix one issue without having to fix others at the same time(i.e. drugs, sex, education, crime, gangs, health, ignorance).

If you truly look at our history, I believe you will see that we have greatly improved over such a short time, but we still have a lot of improvement to go. So we need to come up with fix actions instead of just whining and complaining.

Realizing there was a lot more in our relationship going wrong than just this I formulated the best revenge.

I started dating again, and after not too long met a girl who really makes me happy.  Now I'm 26, have a good job, engaged (and happy), closing on a condo on Friday.  Where is she you might ask... I have no clue because I don't give a fuck.  She made my life miserable so I built a new life without her and never looked back.

Why does reddit act like cheating on your partner is the worst thing you could ever do to them?  Are we all insecure adolescents or something?,"I'm not suggesting that you cheat on your partner, but frankly I'm a little disgusted at the way reddit has taken to demonizing people for doing something that is, frankly, pretty damn common.

Getting cheated on sucks (it's happened to me.)   But it doesn't mean that the cheater instantly becomes a worthless, lower-than-dirt scumbag or a dirty, filthy whore.  That's only how it is in the movies, not in real life, where people make mistakes, and they don't always fall in love forever, and sometimes they just meet someone they like better.

The venom that this community seems to have towards cheaters....well, it smacks of insecurity, hypocrisy, and perhaps a bit of juvenile naivete.

Am I really the only person here who thinks this?

---------------------

Oh, and here are a few statistics about cheating, pulled very unscientifically from just the first few results that Google gave me:

&gt;""Recent studies reveal that 45-55% of married women and 50-60% of married men engage in extramarital sex at some time or another during their relationship (Atwood &amp; Schwartz, 2002 - Journal of Couple &amp; Relationship Therapy)""

&gt;""According to an infidelity poll over over 1,100 women conducted by  over 62% of women thought that men cheat more than women. However, in a similar WomanSaver’s poll of over 850 women, only 67% said they would never cheat on their partner.""

&gt;""According to Annette Lawson, author of Adultery, published in 1989 by Basic Books. ""The various researchers arrive at a general consensus…suggesting that above one-quarter to about one-half of married women have at least one lover after they are married in any given marriage. Married men probably still stray more often than married women—perhaps from 50 percent to 65 percent by the age of forty.""

&gt;""Conservative infidelity statistics estimate that “60 percent of men and 40 percent of women will have an extramarital affair. These figures are even more significant when we consider the total number of marriages involved, since it's unlikely that all the men and women having affairs happen to be married to each other. If even half of the women having affairs (or 20 percent) are married to men not included in the 60 percent having affairs, then at least one partner will have an affair in approximately 80 percent of all marriages. With this many marriages affected, it's unreasonable to think affairs are due only to the failures and shortcomings of individual husbands or wives.""",reddit.com

I'm wondering if I can ""sell"" him a candy bar each week and claim the cash as income (like e-bay/paypal income)?  That way he wouldn't have to file anything.  

I'm also curious as to the ways to get around claiming it at all.  I know there has to be some way that dealers (as Rowleyds13 said) get away with not claiming it.

Omegle: A cry from help from a raped 14 year old Indian girl,"Hello Reddit.

You inspired me to use Omegle after the T-REX vs. pikachu thread.
I was marginally amused with all the random sex jokes exchanged until about 3:30 this afternoon.

I recieved a message in a new Omegle session: ""I am a 14 year old girl, and my boyfriend just forced me to have sex with him, I need someone to talk to please don't disconnect.""

Being calloused as I am, I was skeptical, I replied with a joke, but over the course of our hour long conversation I came to realize that it was horrifyingly true.

She is living in India, somewhere near Bollywood, a member of the Highest Caste. She explained to me, sparing no words, that she had been raped. Her boyfriend threatened to put her in the hospital if she did not have sex with him, he was brutal, she told me he shredded her insides, that now it felt like someone had poured a hot drink inside of her. This was terrifying.

He had only done it 2 hours ago, she said. My brain was in overdrive, trying to think of something, anything I could do. I live in the Midwest, I'm thousands of miles from India, how could I help this girl!? 

I asked if her father could help her, or her mother.
She knows little of her mother, nannies and helpers have taken care of her since she was young. Her father is a stubborn man who is ""not very permissive"" in her words. This was one of the very few boys of whom he approved.

I asked what would happen if she told her father, her response was that he would disown her. She would literally be put on the streets. He would defend her if the boy beat her, but if he rapes her, he is shamed and she is disowned. This infuriated me.

As this entire conversation progressed, my googlefu was returning nothing about rape support groups in Bollywood, let alone in India. Article after article reared its ugly head, detailing rape after rape in India and this made me even angrier.

Time running short and out of ideas, I told the girl about Reddit. What else was I to do? Reddit is the only resource I can think of with so many knowledgeable people.

Reddit, she is scared and feels alone, she will be looking at this site trying to figure this out, I don't know when, but soon. Get this on the front page if we can, maybe we can make a difference.

Is anyone else as mesmerized by Olympic curling as I am?,"So, some friends of mine and myself were flipping through channels this afternoon, and we stumble across women's Olympic curling on CNBC. No one said a word, but the channel stopped, and we sat in this hypnotic silence for the next 30 minutes, just watching. We had no idea why, but we all found it absolutely spellbinding.

But if you were deplaned due to your size, even if it involved a stretch in judgement by a flight attendant, wouldn't your first thought be: ""man, I should try to drop a few before I fly again"" instead of ""I'm going to publicly vindicate myself!""

Reddit Science: Can you explain something about space and time for me?,"Hello all... I was really high the other night and was wondering about something. Not sure if this is completely unfounded or ridiculous sounding, but I have a question... my knowledge of space/time/etc is pretty limited though, so take it easy on me...

It is my understanding that the light that we see from distant stars takes billions of years to reach our eyes, and that some stars we actually are seeing can actually be ""dead"". First off, is this true?

Secondly, if that premise is true, how can we tell that the universe is constantly expanding? How can we even know anything since the realm of these stars is so far out of the realm we live in? If you can distinguish patterns (even if they are billions of years old), how do we know these patterns haven;t changed?

Is it completely possible that some of the things we see in the sky aren't actually ""reality""? Could the sky looks completely different because thousands of the stars we see could have died a long time ago, etc?

I misunderstood the situation on the bus.,"I'd like to quickly say that I feel a lot of the tension as of late on reddit has been a large misunderstanding.

I later heard reports saying that EBM was on the bus earlier that day or that week and was very loud and obnoxious, and that he initially directed him comment at the black guy, asking him to spit shine of his shoes. I can see why this comment offended the black guy.

"Dear Reddit, Here is my idea of how to fix airline policy for overweight people needing 2 seats…treat it the same as carry-on luggage","As the Kevin Smith incident has shown, there really isn’t a well-defined policy to decide who can fit in 1 seat and who needs to buy 2 seats…basically the pilot and/or flight attendant will make a very subjective judgment that a person needs to buy a second seat, sometimes even forcing people on booked flights to get off…QUITE embarrassing. There should be a very well-defined objective way to decide whether someone needs to buy two seats or can fit into one without subjecting them to unneeded embarrassment or subjecting  those sitting next to them to unneeded “squishing”. And unfortunately things like body mass index (BMI) or overall girth are not really reliable indicators in this situation.  
  
**OK SO HERE IS MY IDEA…** We should treat this issue the same way we treat carry-on bags…if it is questionable that your bag won’t fit, before you get on the flight they will make you put your bag in that metal cage and it either fits or it doesn't. So…when you order tickets on-line there will be a question that basically asks *“Due to seat space restrictions do you require and/or wish to purchase a second adjacent seat?”* And the choices are YES, NO, and NOT SURE.   
  
**FOR YES** If you know you require or want 2 adjacent seats you put YES and you can check-in without having to explain why you bought 2 tickets, the person at the check-in counter and the flight attendant will know that you bought two adjacent seats and they won’t need to embarrass you needlessly by asking.  
  
**FOR NOT SURE** If you are overweight but think that you can still fit in 1 seat or honestly don’t know, you can put NOT SURE, and when you go to the check-in counter they will discretely send you to a room where there is a mock row from the airplane with an empty middle seat and two mannequins on either end…you will sit, put the armrests down, THEN buckle yourself, and see clearly whether you can fit within your “designated space allotment,” and if not you need to buy a 2nd seat. And not to be mean, but if the person is saying “NO NO…I FIT...SEE!!!” when obviously they don’t…have a TV monitor or even just digital camera there to show the person how they look crammed in the seat….seeing it from that perspective I think will make the point quite clear.  
  
**FOR NO** If for some reason someone is in complete denial and puts NO when it is clear they at least *might* need 2 seats … discretely pull them aside to the room for “NOT SURE” people anyway.

Help my mum escape this trap.,"Hey Redditors, I need your help. Well, not ME but my mum. 
You see, I come from a less fortunate family (money wise) but my mum has managed to make sure my sister and I get a good education and we always have dinner. 

Recently my mum started attending classes in the hopes that after completing the course she will be in a better position to get a job that pays more then $12.50 an hour (New Zealand minimum wage) and finally escape the nightmare that is the New Zealand benefit. 

But this morning her hopes were crushed. She was denied financial aid for transportation to and from the classes. Her hope to escape the system shattered over less than $60 a week. 

It makes me so angry to see this happen, to me it makes no sense at all. I would help her but I am a jobless student studying Software Engineering at Victoria university in New Zealand. If any one out there can Donate, or give me advice I can forward to my mum she would be so happy.

Is Microsoft stealing my personal information?,"I recently installed Office 2008 office on my home computer.  This computer is mainly used for work purposes, so I was able to get a copy of software from my work.

After installing the software it asks for some personal information.  I went ahead and entered the 'required' files which included name and email.  Address and phone were NOT required so I did not enter this information.  After I clicked OK the program finished normally.  So then for some reason I went and took a look at the personal info that the had on me and was surprised to see that my full address was there and also my phone number was there.  Remember now that I DID NOT ENTER this information.  So did Microsoft illegally access my computer and take this information?  Where did this information come from?

I weep for the shame of those who are forced to oppose our Olympic hockey teams.,"Our women's team is beating Sweden 12-0 and the Swedes still trying. They're trying so hard! I would have given up and walked off the ice by now. But they're still playing and they haven't given up, even though they would have to score a goal every to minutes to win the game at this point. I feel so sorry for them. now the Swedes are trying to play dirty and they can't even get that right. They tripped a Canadian player right in front of the referee and now we have a 2-up power play. It's a massacre. Our goalie is blocking their shots before they make them. 

Normally, a hockey team will avoid a huge point difference. It's considered rude to defeat a team by any margin greater than three points. If you *really* hate them, you go as high as 6-0. I once attended an NHL game in Edmonton where we were beating the Anaheim Mighty Ducks 7-0. We were booing our own team because they were being jerks, beating them so hard. Even though the Mighty Ducks deserved it for having such a silly name. 

But in the Olympics, the medal decision may rest on the total number of goals scored. So they have to go for the jugular. I saw them beat a team 18-0 and I had to shut it off because I felt like crying for the opposing team. I cry when I lose a street hockey game 2-0. Imagine losing by 18 points in the Olympics!

Damn. Second period is up and they're beating them 12-0. This is just painful to watch.",reddit.com

Student wins gold in Gorge Olympics 100 Metre Freefall,"

This is the 11th student who has passed away at Cornell this year with four of them being suicides.

I don't think it's my looks because I'm decent looking (I guess that should be read as I think I'm good looking, people tell me I look good, but I'm not a male model or something), I don't think it's me or my personality (I'm a fun guy, have lots of friends, and pretty easy to get along with), so I guess it's cause I'm just kinda awkward at the whole approaching a woman and asking them out. It's not that I'm scared of women, it's more a thing about logic, I think to myself 'If I were a girl and walking across campus to get to my next class would I want some guy I don't know bothering me? No. More so considering that he walked up to me without knowing me at all must mean he just thinks I'm attractive, and while faltering that is, it's still kinda creepy'... so that's when I come to the conclusion that maybe I shouldn't bother her.

1. the employees are struggling to survive
2. the employees self-esteem is lowered by mistreatment
3. the sum of 1+2 may increase the risk of the employee lashing out at the customers by either producing defective product, poor service, etc.

    Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown
    And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command
    Tell that its sculptor well those passions read
    Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,
    The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed.

    ""My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:

"Reddit, I'm fucking pissed off with my cable service and I don't even know the proper subreddit in which to rant","Cablevision, it turns out, is replacing SD channels with HD ones.  What this means is: if you have an HD cable box and there's an HD version of a channel you will **only** get the HD version of that channel.  You can no longer watch it in SD.

So basically, every Cable station that's not a premium channel or one of the big four is out of aspect ratio.  What I watch most regularly is the Adult Swim programming block on Cartoon Network, and now every single program is going to be stretched. (forcing 4:3 on my television also puts the channel in the wrong aspect ratio, as the process that almost everyone uses to upscale involves some amount of zooming as well)

I'm fucking pissed about it.  Between internet and television service, we pay a lot of fucking money to Cablevision every month and they pull shit like this...  If I want to watch something in the proper aspect ratio, I need to watch it on a regular tv, now.

You see, twice now I've stayed up so late reading your posts and endless comments that I've slept through my two hardest classes. They're 8am and then 9:30 classes, required by my major. I can't afford to miss them. 

So while our love is evident to all my friends, it needs to be over--for me. I need to do this for me. I hope you understand. Here's how our relationship is going to change.

I will be deleting your free application from my iPod. The university has wireless in all the classes, and it's too damn tempting and easy to check if there are any new posts, thereby missing what the professor said about the Shrödinger equation. 

You will no longer be my home page. I still haven't decided on about:blank or google.

I will be getting one of my friends to put a password of their choosing on your page. Sure, this may sound excessive, but if I don't do this, I won't be able to move on.

I love you, Reddit, but this is my final good-bye. You've become too big a part of my life, and I need to make room for that which is more important--school. If I could, I'd give away my link karma, even though it's a mere 1237.

(and posts like this) has made this site suck for me. After a few years, here, I'm out.","Yeah, yeah, yeah. Who gives a shit, amirite? You are. I nonetheless figured that I should make my exit with exactly the same kind of self-referential recursive insanity that Reddit has become; it seems fitting.

A day ago, after deleting my main account, lurking for a few hours with a new one, and eventually deleting that one, I've decided that Reddit is a time-sink, and not even a good one. I might check out some of the sub-reddits, now and then, but this site has devolved into a handful of boring memes. It's absolutely devoid of cleverness or anything interesting. I don't care if you're good at grammar. I don't care about your kids or your pets. I don't care if you edited your post for grammar. I don't care if you've jumped on a meme bandwagon. I don't care if you go to /b/. I don't care about whether or not you think something is epic, win or fail.

I hate it, and I hate you. Suck it. I don't care about your looks of disapproval.

I used to shrug off posts like this in the past. Now I realize that they were on to something. The last straw for me was ""ambalamps."" There was a time when Reddit would have been able to see that video as two idiots getting into a fight. Instead, it's become about a white knight standing up to savage niggery.

"Reddit, what are your best office pranks?","I'm in the middle of trying my darndest to liven up the shift of my coworker who begins at 6 am. So far, I've:

- taped the his mouse to the desk
- disabled his phone headset (with a piece of paper that's impossible to see, so he won't know until he gets a call) and set the phone ringer to max volume (IT support here, so phones are a big part of the job)
- taped the phone to his desk behind his computer monitor
- taped over the power button of his computer, so it looks normal, but more likely than not will not power up the computer
- rigged his chair so that it looks normal but will deflate into the lowest position as soon as he takes a seat

He's a swell guy, and we get along well (he did leave scotch tape lying around though!). It's all part of the fun to play these harmless pranks on each other.

She has a boyfriend who lives out of town, and she's basically my best friend in a new town where I know very few people.  We are really tight, but we are not dating and not planning on dating, just hooking up when we get the urge.  
Now I have recently met this other girl, lets call her Jan, who I am pretty into, and she is digging on me.  We have made out, but no further mainly because I figured honesty was the way to go and I explained my situation with Alice.
Now the problem I have is that I kind of want to juggle both of them at the same time.  Alice is down with this plan, but I think Jan wants me more to herself, which I wouldn't be against, but I don't want to fuck things up with Alice.  
So the question is how do I handle this situation?  Do I just keep leading Jan on and try to juggle both of them? Do I tell Jan that I can't be with her because I have Alice on the side? Do I tell Alice that we are done hooking up because I want to bone Jan?

Question for anyone who voted for Obama,"During the election I saw a bunch of kids at my school who were bashing the previous Bush administration and McCain and favoring Obama. I would have not had a problem with this except their bashes were not really well-thought out, like ""they just want a war"" or ""because Obama wants free healthcare, and that's good"". Naturally this got me kind of pissed off because after at least one question I shot a hole so big through their arguments that you could drive a submarine through them. 

But the most numerous of these comments went something like this; somebody asked one of these Obama supporters why they like him so much or why they would vote for him (if they could) and a lot of them  just simply responded ""because he's black"". I assumed this was just because they were kids, but after watching some interviews with ordinary people on the news it became apparent that adults would actually vote for him based entirely on the color of his skin.  

My question is this: Did anybody on here vote, or know someone who voted, for Obama simply because he is black/his opposition was white?",reddit.com

Why are Americans so batshit crazy when it comes to taxes?,"Naturally, I'm thinking about this guy who flew his plane into the IRS building. (I know people who work in that building in Austin, sheerly by coincidence.) There are many countries where people pay substantially more in taxes than in the U.S., where failing to pay taxes is illegal and carries penalties, and so on. Why do people in the U.S. go so utterly apeshit over taxes?

We have whole political philosophies devoted to the attempt to justify the moral rightness of failing to pay one's taxes. Everything stands and falls on taxes. Decline in education, infrastructure and even growth can be partly attributed to a hatred of taxes. States like California are foundering entirely on the inability to raise taxes. 

I guarantee if you go to any country that has low economic development, low literacy, horrible infrastructure and so on, the common denominator is that the richer people don't pay taxes. (Many of these countries use IGA or sales taxes as their primary tax collection method.)

I don't get it. I pay plenty of my salary in taxes. The other day, I realized I don't even count the portion of my salary that is taxes as really part of my salary. It just makes sense to me that I should pay taxes. My parents got this huge economic bonanza during Bush because they are in that wealthier tax bracket that benefited from his absurd tax reform and they welcome paying more tax if it will keep the country from going down the drain. 

I don't understand what it is that makes Americans so particularly nuts about taxes. My theories are: (1) People in America love to shop and calculate what they could get at the mall for the money they pay in taxes, whatever the devastation to the country. In other words, we simply don't have a civic minded culture. We're selfish and it is every man for himself (2) It's a kind of peculiar and witless attempt at seeking personal freedom, stemming from the rhetoric we learn surrounded the revolutionary war.

I know another reason is that they've been brainwashed to be obsessed with this issue, without most people recognizing that they ultimately benefit from income taxes enormously and that the only people who really are worse off are the extremely wealthy.",reddit.com

Privacy Invasion: How did Facebook know to suggest my landlord as a friend?,"Facts:

1. I have a facebook account.  I use a non-gmail account for logging in.
2. I used to have it so you couldn't find me by searching for my name, so some people suggested I join facebook using my gmail address.
3. I periodically receive e-mails from facebook to my gmail reminding me that some people want to be my friends and I should join.  I usually ignore these.
4. These e-mails (or at least the most-recent one) contain both ""these people have invited you to facebook"" and ""you might also know these people on facebook"" sections.
4. I just got one of those reminders, and my landlord was one of the people on facebook that I ""might also know"".
5. I have never done anything related to my landlord on facebook, and none of the people who have invited me to facebook via my gmail have any relation to my landlord.
6. I use completely different passwords for my gmail as my other accounts.

How the %&amp;(# did this happen?  Is it &amp;%^ing BUZZ's fault when it made all my gmail contacts public?  Is facebook scouring those results and making suggestions for me based upon them?  (The odd thing is that I don't *think* that my BUZZ contact list was ever public, 'cause my google profile said I had to add more info to make it public...)

Should I get a degree in physics?,"I am about to graduate with a degree in biochemistry in may.  I could easily apply to grad school for biochemistry and continue from there, but.....
   Without going into all of the details, I originally considered getting a degree in physics, but decided against it for various reasons (although I am fully intellectually capable of it).  Since then I have had more experience with physics, including a tutoring job for premeds in introductory physics.  It turns out that I like it.
   In addition, I am not exactly sure what I want to do with my life.  I haven't really started the process for applying to grad school, and anyway I am not sure I am really ready for it psychologically, (I think I am fully prepared academically).  I literally do not know what the hell I am going to be doing in 6 months. Also, I seem to remember that a noticeable amount of the more interesting researchers in biochemistry that I have come across also had some background in physics.
In this state, I may be having a change of heart about getting an additional degree in physics.  I can't help but think that the greater background in mathematics etc, would turn out to be a great help to any scientist.  Which I think in the end is what I want to be, a researcher/professor etc.  Though I am not 100% certain.

  On the other hand, I am already 22 and I am not sure I could pass it by my parents successfully.  Not to mention getting the government to pay for anymore....  

  Alternatively, the physics department here seems almost desperate to get more undergrads even though it is a major university and has a Nobel laureate in the department.  I do research and work for a biophysicist so I have a little behind the scenes experience. It may be that I could talk to them and procure some money. 

I guess what I want is some advice.  What do you think?  Should I pursue knowledge without a clear goal or should I just grow up and go to grad school for the degree I have basically already gotten?",reddit.com

Redditor employs Osama Bin Laden rationale to justify Austin IRS plane bombing,"[  ]

Here is the comment:

""The man believed in a cause and made a statement to the blind government. Americans today wont send back uncooked food much less have the balls to stand up like this man did. He went after the principle (the buiding). The loss of life is unfortunate, but he got his message out, and it was a meaningful one at that. We're not talking some school shooting or postal vendetta here. People are talking, we can only hope legislation follows. Yeah right.""

Here is my response:

""Do you know that avowed terrorists reason in the manner you are doing here ?

And, are you aware that the very argument you've just used can be employed to justify the September 11, 2001 terrorists attack that demolished the World Trade Center ?

Boy, oh boy, that one sure ""got the message out.""

The rationale is the same as terrorist groups the world over have used for decades (and centuries probably) to justify the killing of innocent civilians to advertise and advance political causes.

"Reddit, I found this cry for help on the Queensboro Bridge. This man's son is at the University of Cambridge. Do any UK Redditors know him?","*Ok, as much as I hate to rewrite a text box completely, I feel like my original explanation was causing a lot of confusion, so I'm breaking the unwritten redditique here and starting again.*

This afternoon I was walking on the Queensboro Bridge and I found this bottle. Inside was a note, which upon first reading, sounded a lot like the typical 419 Nigerian prince emails. The author described his desperation, drowning in loans, failing business, no where to turn, etc, etc, and contemplating suicide. If you take it seriously, he wrote it with the naive hope that whoever found it can loan him the money he needs. The odd thing is, he ends by giving all his bank details so that I could wire money to him directly. So assuming it's accurate, I could probably rip him off easier than he can rip me off. 

I started to entertain the thought that maybe it was legit. Now, I'm not about to give an anonymous letter writer a massive loan and I'm not going to ask anyone else do that either. But in the letter he mentions a son who works for the University of Cambridge and that was something I could verify. I reached out to Reddit to see if anyone knew him. No one seemed to, but I got a response with his email address within about 15 minutes.

I also posted the letter but removed all his bank account details (to protect him if it's legit) and then removed his contact information (to protect anyone tempted to give money in case it's a scam). 

A few people saw the suspicious letter I posted and assumed that I had invented this guy as part of my own complex 419 scam. My own fault for not being clearer about this. I purposely removed all this guy's information so that no one can give him money. And I have no intention of asking Reddit for anything on his behalf. The people of Haiti need it more, this guy just needs some good guidance. Here is the letter as I posted it earlier:

page 1

page 2

I posted this because I thought it was an interesting thing to find. And also because on the slim chance that it's real, I don't want to ignore a cry for help, simple as that. I have emailed the son to try to verify the story and alert him to this news about his father, if it is. If can verify it, I'll try to offer some financial advice to them. And if not, nothing lost. At the worst, it was a minor waste of my time.

Thanks for reading. 

**EDIT:** Woke up this morning to find that both father and son responded to my emails. The father thanked me for the words of encouragement and gave me more information about his situation (his gf encouraged the message in the bottle thing). He hasn't asked me for another cent, but instead asked me for an opinion on the novel he's writing. I can't even make this stuff up. The son (from a university email address, mind you) confirmed all the details and said that he hadn't heard from his father for a while but would get in touch immediately. Thanks Reddit, we may have helped some guy out :)",reddit.com
I feel sorry for Tiger Woods. I will explain.,"I'm aware that I'll get downvoted to oblivion. Bring it on, blue arrows!

Here's why:
1) Tiger Woods is a handsome man, the global face of a sport, and his career earnings have exceeded $1 billion dollars. While I am not privy to his personal life, I would hazard a guess that millions of women wanted and continue to want to drain his balls 8 ways from Sunday. In all likelihood, he was constantly tempted by a bevy of staggeringly beautiful women entirely willing to break up his marriage. While he shouldn't have cheated, none of us will ever fully understand the constant temptation that this man faced.

2) Again, while I do not condone cheating, who Tiger Woods sleeps with is his business. Period. If his wife disapproves (and she does, I would hope), she should get a lawyer, and divorce him. In an ideal world, this would all be done privately. This isn't an ideal world, and he gets publicly shamed.

3) He owes his wife and his family an apology. His acts were dishonourable to them. He does not owe anyone else an apology. He didn't do anything to them. Instead, he has to deliver a nationally televised apology that will be covered ad nauseum for days.

4) The fact that he's a role model doesn't change anything. All we should know about this man is that he's great at golf, and that people who want to be great at golf should model their play after his. Ultimately, it is our collective insatiable demand for information concerning Tiger's personal life, information we have no right to know, that has forced this man into hiding for months and hindered his career.

And that's why I feel sorry for Tiger. Let the hatred begin.",reddit.com

"Reddit, help stop my favorite state park in NY from being shut down.","



This is Thacher Park which is just south of Albany, NY. Governor Patterson has decided to close down several parks, including this one to cover the state budget crisis. It was DONATED to NYS from John Boyd Thacher, and I don't think the state should have any right to shut it down to the public. This is the most scenic place around the Capital Region in New York. My family has a cabin just down the road at the lake. From the spot you can see downtown Albany, mountains in Vermont and Mass., as well as the Adirondack mountains. It's full of history from some of the first settlements in New York and the Indian Ladder trail with some beautiful waterfalls that you can right underneath.

To me this place is like a second home to me and it's right near where my grandmother's resting place is. When I'm there, it feels like as if I'm in the right place, that I don't need anything else. If you can, please sign the petition below. It may not mean much, but it means a lot to me.

"I'm a Lightbulb-Changing sceptic, and I invite you to change my mind.","Dear Reddit. Let's take it for granted that I accept Climate Change is happening, and is caused by human activity.

What I don't accept is that *changing my lightbulbs* will fix it.

I live in a country where incandescent lightbulbs have been banned by the federal government, and I'm bombarded by messages telling me, personally, to save energy, because this reduces ""carbon"" emissions and will help the environment.

Two problems -- the most obvious one? Even if everyone in the whole country cut their electricity consumption in half overnight, it wouldn't make a difference to the big picture unless we could ask India and China to pretty please, *not* have your Industrial Revolutions.

But more annoying to me is the fundamentally broken idea that, in a free-market capitalist economy, my reducing the amount of electricity I personally consume will help. 

We're not in a centrally-controlled wartime economy, where I can give up my aluminium saucepans and they will actually be turned into Spitfires, or where all groceries are controlled by a Ministry Of Food and I know that, while I may not get to eat much beef, at least our boys at the front are well fed to fight Hitler.

If I reduce electricity consumption, doesn't that just lower the demand, which will lower the price, which will mean the same amount of electricity, or more, consumed overall? If everyone reduces their domestic energy consumption by half, do the electricity companies just shut down half their production and give their workers the afternoon off?  Has the government nationalised power generation? Are they managing its graceful phase-out into the Brave New Green World of tomorrow where everyone has solar cells on their roof and is carbon neutral? I don't believe so. So what is the point of telling me that I can Do My Bit by reducing my personal energy consumption?

**TL;DR**: I work hard. Why should I feel guilty about coming home and watching my big-screen TV? If I don't use that little bit of electricity, someone else will.",reddit.com
"Sorry, another Tiger post.  This guy isn't a god damn sex addict.  Stop making emotions illegal and stop whitewashing affairs with the ""Addiction"" cop out.","He fucked another woman.  In fact, multiple women.  While what the guy did was dishonest to his wife, it ends there. The fact that he was basically forced to go on national TV and call himself a sex addict is fucking mean.  It's dangerous to label people who make bad choices ""addicts"".  This is just the classic Christian brainwashing that tells us that expressing our sexual side is wrong and immoral and if you make a mistake, you're some kind of chronic pervert with no mental stability or moral direction whatsoever. Should he have dealt with the situation differently?  Yes.  But should society be so quick to go ""man that guy's a fucking pervert""? No. 

Further, to add to the notion that this shit shouldn't be on the news, let's put it into perspective.  While tiger is rolling in money and banging women we'd never get in our best dreams, the same people chastising woods are doing shit like cheating, child molestation, cross dressing, beastiality (as funny as it is), and rape.  I'm not saying everyone in society is a sexual monster but if the people putting woods up on the chopping block thought for a second about the shit they've done, maybe he wouldn't have gotten so much media attention.

We shouldn't be so quick to shun those who have affairs and actually treat them like human beings instead of guilty gutter slime who have to go on TV and basically tarnish their reputation forever.

But seriously, Reddit is a community where we can intellectually discuss the world around us. It is not supposed to be a popularity contest of opinions. It is a crucible through which each of us are tempered through the fires of debate and examination. This requires us to accept differing opinions as valuable, even if they are something which we find utterly abhorrent. 

The downvote button is not a hammer of vengeance wielded against all undeserving heretics, but a tool used to weed out the the trolls, the disruptive, and the lazy. If an opinion doesn't contribute to the discussion, downvote it. If you don't agree with a point, argue against it in the comments, and by all means, don't upvote it. Use your upvotes as positive reinforcement for what you do agree with. 

Recklessly downvoting only creates a self-reinforcing system, a sounding board that only echos the same voices back. We do not learn anything this, but instead become locked in the same modes of thought. We stagnate intellectually.
