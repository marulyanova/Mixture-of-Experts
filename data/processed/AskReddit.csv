Is the internet speed in the US really that bad?,"I've been seeing a lot of articles about how X country's internet is Y times faster than the internet in the United States or X country proposed new internet legislation that will make their nationwide internet Y times faster than the internet in the U.S.

But really, is the internet in the U.S. that bad? I mean, I have Comcast. I just ran a speedtest and got a ping of 53ms, downspeed of 23.03Mb/s, and upspeed of 3.00Mb/s. Admittedly, it's a good day for internet speed, but I rarely get below 12Mb/s downspeed. I don't download media illegally. I enjoy Hulu and Youtube. I play MMORPG's and download Linux CD images. Sometimes I download or torrent games and updates legally, and it takes a little patience, but I don't mind. But for consumer internet, I have no complaints with my speed.

I don't know. I got first got the internet when I was in early grade school, back in the early 90's, before anyone else I knew got it. My ISP was IDT. THAT was slow internet. A WEBSITE with PICTURES? You'd be waiting a few minutes.

How should I approach my girlfriend about blowjobs?,"I feel really childish and selfish for asking this question, but the truth is that although I'm a 23 year old male who has been going out with my girlfriend since high-school began, I have yet to receive oral sex from her.

However, I can't seem to figure out how to approach her about getting a blowjob. I don't want her to think I'm selfish, and although conversations have began (of her own accord) regarding ""returning the favor"" those conversations end quickly and she forgets them.

It would help to mention that when she was little she was raped by a close family member, so she may be scared (or something) of blowjobs. She's alluded to this many times as being the reason but her responses aren't sufficient.

I found a job posting online for my current position. Any advice on how to handle this?,"A little background: In November I was hired into a non-management position at a salary about 5k less than I had been making at the job I got laid off from in September. The plan was for me to work with the current manager for 2 or 3 months after which she would leave the position to go back to school and I would be promoted to manager. I've actually got several years more experience than her so this seemed fine. I took the job. 

One day after I was hired she announced she would be leaving the company in 2 weeks. Instead of 3 months to train I had 2 weeks during the busiest time of the year for the company. The transition was a little rough but over the past month I've slowly been bringing some order to a system that was completely chaotic. Very few employees had been trained properly, equipment was all out of calibration, documents had errors in them, etc. 

I haven't been given any negative feedback on my job so far. In fact, on Friday they assigned 2 additional employees to work for me (so now I'm managing 9 people.) Furthermore we haven't had any major disasters that could be considered my fault. 

Today I discover a job posting advertising my exact title at my current company. It's a small company entering our slowest time of the year, business-wise and there's no room for two managers with my title. I conclude that they're going to try to replace me with someone with more experience who will work for the same non-competitive wage (20k under the industry average for the position.) 

The owner is kind of a prick and this is PRECISELY the kind of thing I would expect him to do. He finds excuses to fire pregnant women so he doesn't have to pay their health insurance during their leave. The company's main production location has so many OHSA violations that it would be a 6-figure fine if it ever got inspected. 

I can't decide if I should just flat-out ask the owner of the company why the position was posted or if I should just wait it out and see what they do.",AskReddit

Have you ever been a complete social outcast? Did you wish to be accepted by your peers? Can you give some decent advice?,"This is a problem that I've faced since middle school. Since the age of 12 or so, I've noticed that people treat me much differently than my peers. I'm 20 years old, male, a virgin, and I don't have any real friends. I am of average height, overweight by 50 lbs, and have an unattractive face. 

I spend my weekends and free time on the internet, not by choice, but instead for lack of anything better to do. I've always wanted to hang out with people, but I never get invited anywhere. I've tried hosting parties at my place, but people never show up. In most activities or clubs I've showed up at, I always come in alone, and find that most people have formed friendship groups (with me excluded). I've tried to be outgoing, friendly, and open to other people, but nobody seems to accept a casual invitation.

I've tried being kind. When I do, people end up taking advantage of me, using me for favors, or walking all over me. I've tried entertaining people, to be the life of the party. This usually ends in people encouraging me to make a fool of myself, and I used to fall for the bait. 

I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I'm sitting here almost in tears, wondering why I can't fit in anywhere. Why I've never had a real friend, why women aren't attracted to me, why I've failed miserably at basic social interactions.

Whenever I try and chat up a girl, I get this **strong** vibe that she doesn't want me there. It's not irrational, it's not anxiety. Many will simply stop talking to me, or be unresponsive. I'm not overly pushy, but never get the chance to talk about anything other than simple greetings. It feels like talking to a wall, or like batting against an empty machine. You can swing for the fences, but what's the use if you're never given anything to hit?

So where do I go from here? It is so frustrating to be ignored when talking in a group. It is heartbreaking to have a table of people go from friendly chatting to dead silence when I sit down. I'm not creepy, I'm not confrontational, and I understand basic etiquette. Do I become a complete jackass? A miser? A hermit?

I wish for nothing more than to be accepted by my peers, to feel as if I'm a part of a group, or of something. Yet, this seems far out of reach.

Landlord/Condo Ass. Screw over?  Help?,"I just recently got a new apartment, I love the place.  I was told I could have a dog (I have the emails to prove this), and it is explicitly stated so in my lease.

How would you dress up as something that begins with the first letter of your first name.,"Hello fellow redditors, this is my first time redditing (please be kind).
I am going to a party next week. The theme is 'Dress up as something that begins with the first letter of your first name'. My formal name begins with L and my nickname begins with R.
At first I thought about dressing up as a ruler.
I have to be honest and say that I am totally clueless on what to dress up as.
Currently I'm thinking of going as Lionel Messi I have his kit so just need to borrow some shin pads and I'm all set. But I think it will be hard for me to pull of, since I'm South-East Asian. 
Any interesting and out-of-this world ideas for me would be greatly appreciated.

"Hi reddit, I haven't had a job in 4 years, have an interview tomorrow. Need some help...","I am 24. Last time I had a job I was 20. After high school, I went to college for a couple of years, dropped out, then went crazy for a few years with anxiety, borderline, mild agoraphobia. Basically became a depressed shut in. I have lied about having a job to my friends/girlfriends(my relationships usually don't last very long) for years. Now, a friend of mine is getting me a job at a pizza place as a driver. He has worked there for years, I knew the store manager because he was good friends with my brother many years ago. He seemed excited at the possibility of me working there. 

The problem is, I need to keep up the lie for my made up current employment. So I need to make up past work references. I was thinking about fudging something about working at circuit city and extending my education years a little bit. Then putting a company as my current employer. I am afraid that they will contact these people bringing my web of lies crashing down. I am a nice loving person and a hard worker, just suffer from some serious depression. I want this to work, I have been down for a long time.

How can anyone be for the death penalty when trials (based on a jury) are never going to be fair and bring real justice?,"I watch lots of crime dramas and read lots of the news, so maybe my understanding is skewed, but as far as I know: A jury is selected, these are people from the public called forward to do jury duty. A lot of these people don't want to be there, they want to go back to doing their jobs or looking after their family, so that would bring me to the conclusion they don't necessarily care that much (of course some people take it seriously, but it only takes 1 not to...).

So how can this be fair? How can a jury of ""normal"" people who don't necessarily have any interested in being there and people who could be easily swayed by charisma be given the responsibility of deciding if someone is guilty?

Let's not forget how lawyers are different, a poor person could get a really shit lawyer who knows very little of what they do and represent the person poorly, or a rich person could get the best lawyer around. If both were charged with the same crime and the evidence was flaky, you can be pretty sure the rich guy will get off and the poor guy will be convicted, because representation matters a great deal. 

How can people who agree with the Death Penalty think this is right? I would never really agree that the death penalty is *good* or *right*, but I could understand it **if** it was possible to be 100% sure of someone's guilt.

tl;dr: How can anyone agree with the death penalty when the people relied on to form a decision aren't necessarily in the position to do so properly? How can anyone agree with the death penalty when the representation of the accused matters a huge deal?

Help me come out of this situation!!,"Hi Reddit,

(My sentence framing wont be impressive as I am not that much good at English language.)

Pleas help me come out of this situation.3 years back I was working in a software company as a developer.There was this guy who was my colleague in the same company &amp; we both shared common interests about entrepreneurship. One day he decided to quit the company to start his own project(web based). Besides working in the same company I used to help him in his project development &amp; I was more like moral support to him. He used to praise me about my support, my creative skills, my passion towards Entrepreneurshsip &amp; we became very close. After a year I too decided to quit the company to join in his project in the marketing field &amp; he was very happy about it. He made an oral commitment that we both will share 40% of profits each &amp; 20% goes to his uncle who was an investor to his project. At that time I never concentrated much on legal things as I wanted to help him build the product.

When I joined him, the project was still under development- he was in the technical field doing coding &amp; I was in the marketing. After a month or so things started getting bad between us. He never used to like my work, my skills &amp; he used to show his frustration on me on whatever I do. He used to underrate me about not knowing technical skills &amp; I used to get hurt really bad. Even if I wanted to learn technical skills he wouldn't let me do that saying ""you cannot learn it"". Not knowing what to do I used to do all kind of crap work in his project &amp; after 10 months when the project was about to go live, we had an argument again &amp; this time he criticized me very badly about my work. So finally I decided that I need to quit working for his project &amp; that decision did not bother him at all. When I asked him about the compensation, as I had invested some money which I saved during my job days, he refused to pay it saying I did not deserve anything. This time I scolded him very badly about his integrity, morality &amp; loyalty. Finally I quit his project &amp; for the next 2 months I could not do anything as I got really depressed. I lost money, time &amp; in the eyes of the people I am an idiot. Now I have started to work out on everything, building technical skills, working on my self-esteem &amp; looking for a job. 

Now he launched his project &amp; sends me an email once every two weeks to sign up for his website. I don't want to think about him at all but when he sends me an email I get depress again &amp; will waste 2 days on it thinking about the past.

"Dear Reddit, Need Help! (Seattle)","Dear Reddit,

I was in charge of performances for the Japanese Student Association, Matsuri Festival. Our Matsuri festival is on February 27th, 2010 at the University of Washington from 5 PM until 9 PM.

Due to the inner workings at University of Washington (where our president gets paid nearly a million dollars), and the tuition hikes (14% this year, and 16% increase next year... 30% in 2 years) and the lack of funding for student organizations. I'm in an **extreme** pinch.

We didn't have as much money as we thought we would have for our Matsuri festival. The cost of renting the room increased, the amount of food we need increased and everything. We simply are unable to pay honorarium/performance fees.

My budget shrank considerably down to $500. I needed at least $1,500. My budget is barely enough to get two decent performers. We need a total of 8-9. I really want to present an authentic, and good performances so people can really get a sense of Japan through it, and get a new experience.

If you're talented, or know someone who is talented and can do something related to Japan for free please PM me!

-- ABOUT MATSURI --

It's a festival we hold annually. This is the 4th annual Matsuri festival. It's centered around introducing Japanese culture to the local community, university students, people interested in Japan or people who just want to have an interesting experience. We usually get around 2,000+ people comprising of kids, parents, high school kids and university students,

We present Japanese culture through performances, games, food and other forms of entertainment. Also, the entrance is free, because we want to make this accessible to anyone and everyone. However, food costs tickets ($1 = 2 tickets, and food is around 2-8 tickets).

Can you have an encrypted message that decrypts into two different messages based on the key?,"Suppose you wanted to pretend to someone (that was ignorant of cryptography) that you had psychic powers or some shit like that (I don't, but just as a thought experiment).

Now, you have two decryption keys, one will decrypt the message one way, and the other, the other way.

I was reading that a message encrypted with a one-time pad couldn't be broken because, since the key is the same length as the message, it could be anything.

So could you have two messages and two different one-time pad encryption keys that both translate into the same encrypted message?

I don't care if anyone says *how* it's done because I don't plan to do anything with this info, it's just curiosity.

What is the most unique human ability that separates us from other animals?,"What do you guys think separates us from the rest of the animal kingdom? What can humans do that other animals cannot?

I took a ""Theory of Human Uniqueness"" class at my university. The theory states that the most unique human ability is our elite throwing skill. No other animal can throw an object as well as a human. Our big brains, our ability to cooperate with the non-kin, our ability to afford to take years to bring up our young are all the outcome of our elite ability to throw.

The name of my professor was Paul M. Bingham and this is his theory:
#Human_evolutionary_biology

""He has developed the theory further in a self-published book, Death from a Distance and the Birth of a Humane Universe (BookSurge, 2009). This work builds on W.D. Hamilton’s theory of kin selection (Benefit x Relatedness &gt; Cost) and posits that the Homo genus evolved when an ancestral organism developed the ability to effectively manage non-kin conflicts of interests by lowering the cost of coercion between non-kin individuals (Benefit &gt; Cost of Coercion + Cost of Cooperation).

...

According to his theory, the cost of coercing a cheating individual in a cooperative effort, otherwise known as the free-rider problem, was lowered when a precursor species to modern humans developed a way to threaten adult con-specifics from a distance by evolving the ability to throw. This diffused the risk to the predator formulated by Lanchester's Square Law. It proposes that we evolved the ability to repel predators and scavenge their kills in the African savannah. This was later adapted as threat projection towards free-riding con-specifics in non kin cooperative groups.""

what to do about an extortionist roommate?,"long time reader first time poster...

So my roommate payed me a sum of 1100 to take two classes for him last semester. i attended class, sat for exams, etc for him the entire semester in each of the two classes. At the end I/he came out with a B in one class and a D the other. At my uni a D is not a passing grade so he was upset, as would be expected, and I honestly felt bad for the guy (though not too bad he was a prick about it the entire time). So at the beginning of this semester, upon his demand, I payed him back some of the money for the class I got the D in (all total, including my ""services"", the class cost him ~1000$ and I payed him back 300$). That's the backstory.

Now suddenly (a month after having settled the entire thing) he wants all of his money back because I didn't get an A in the other class and got the D in the first. More importantly he's threatening me with bodily harm (""i'll kill you"" while making a slicing motion across his neck with a steak knife) .

I donated $100 to Direct Relief International on behalf on Reddit. This morning I received this email. Please tell me this is not true.,"Hi Mr.  ----------

Thank you for asking about us.  Gerald told me you had emailed after learning we had been sent to Haiti to help with the relief effort.  Anyway, Shanklin and I are back.
 
We flew in at 3 AM Sunday to the scene of such incredible destruction on one side, and enormous ineptitude and criminal neglect on the other.

Port Au Prince is in ruins. The rest of the country is fairly intact. Our team was a rescue team and we carried special equipment that locates people buried under the rubble. There are easily 200,000 dead, the city smells like a charnal house. The UN was there for 5 years doing apparently nothing but wasting US taxpayers money. The ones I ran into were either incompetent or outright anti-American.  Most are French or French speakers, worthless, every damned one of them. While 1800 rescuers were ready willing and able to leave the airport and go do our jobs, we were stopped by the UN and USAID (another organization full of little OBama cronnies and communists that openly speak against America). These two organizations exemplared their parochialism by:

USAID, when in control of all inbound flights, had food and water flights stacked up all the way to Miami waiting to land, yet allowed Geraldo Rivera, Anderson Cooper and a host of other left wing news puppies to land.

(Jamison said you told him when you heard Bill Clinton was headed that way and you believed everything would stop while he toured the area and ""looked"" concerned.  You were so right).  Pulled all the security off the rescue teamsso that he and his wife could have the grand tour, whille we sat unable to get to people trapped in the rubble.

Stacked enough food and water for the relief over at the side of the airfield then put a guard on it while we stayed dehydrated and wouldn't release a drop of it to the rescuers.

No shower facilities to decontaminate after digging or moving corpses all day, except for the FEMA teams who brought their own shower and decon equipment, as well as air conditioned tents.

No latrine facilities, unless digging a hole. If you set up a latrine everyone was trying to use it.

I watched a 25 year old Obama appointee with the USAID shrieking hysterically, berating a full bird colonel in the Air Force, because he countermanded her orders, whille trying to unscrew the air pattern. ""You don't know what your President wants! The military isn't in charge here, we are!"" (thats an understatement)

If any of you are thinking of giving money to the Haitian relief, or to the UN don't waste your money.  I believe we have enough issues here and your money is being wasted.  You read it right, wasted.

Bad place, bad situation, but a perfect look at the new world order in action. New Orleans magnified a thousand times. Haiti doesn't need democracy, what Haiti needs is Papa Doc. That's not just my opinion, that is what virtually every Haitian we talked with said. The French-run UN treat us the same as when we were a colony, at least Papa Doc ran the country.

Oh, and as a last slap in the face the last four of us had to take US Airways home from Phoenix. They slapped me with a $90 dollar baggage charge for the four of us. The girl at the counter was almost in tears because she couldn't give us a discount or she would lose her job. Pass that on to the flying public.

"Reddit, I need to stop or slow down gambling","First of all, long time user/contributer/poster/reader, and I apologize for the throwaway account but I'd like to retain some form of anonymity here with this.

Long story short, I'd like to stop gambling. It's not so much the financial part of it -- although that is a contributing factor. I just don't think it's healthy to go blow $1,200 (or around there) a couple/few times a month.

I'd give 100% financial control to my wife, but I do need some control of it or bills will get forgotten -- and I'll still find a way to get the money if I want to.

I enjoy the social aspect of sitting at a Blackjack or Ultimate Texas Hold'em, and playing. Talking with the dealer and other players, and just making bets. I play right, I'm not reckless with my gambling or anything -- I just seem to always hit bad cards.


I play Blackjack by a specific set of rules and have done very well in years past -- it just seems that within the last year I've hit some of the worst runs of cards I've ever seen. I bet anywhere from $3-50/hand depending on my bankroll and how the night is going/how I'm feeling.


I'd like to find some ways to NOT gamble so much or even at all. I've tried distracting myself, but I generally still get that urge and think ""Well, maybe I can make it worth the trip!"" but usually end up leaving empty pocketed.

My wife knows and doesn't seem to care too much. We do okay with money and as long as we can pay the bills and eat she seems fine. 

I'm embarrassed by what appears to my addiction to gambling, and I have too much damned pride for gambler's anonymous.

Any methods that have worked for other gamblers? When I get the urge, I try to remember what it feels like to lose so much, but then I remember what it's like to cash out $24,000 after an insane run as well.

I enjoy gambling, but I know it's not healthy and the money could be better used.

"I've scoured the internet, learned alot, but nothing beats reddit. So reddit, what are your tips for losing weight?","I suppose it'd probably be helpful to know my ""specs"". I'm 6'3, around 235 pounds, and I have a medium frame. I've set my target weight, at the lowest, to 210, which people tell me would be almost unhealthy. While I appreciate any and all advice concerning weight loss, I do have a couple specific questions. 

- Sometimes when I wake up in the morning the weigh myself, my weight will be DRASTICALLY different than the day before. For example, on saturday I weighed myself and I was 236. The next day? I was 231. I had worked out and followed my high fiber diet (which isnt really a diet, just all high fiber foods). What can explain this? I always take these results with a pinch of salt because its simply impossible. 

- How do I know if I'm working out correctly? I feel sore afterwards in some situations, but in others I don't feel very sore at all. 
     (followup)- Should I work out while I'm sore? What If i'm only slightly sore? 

- Is Muscle Memory a good thing or a bad thing? 

- In my current diet, I'm trying to eat foods that are high in either protein or fiber, and the only other thing I'm really taking into account is sugar. Is this acceptable if I'm trying to lose weight? 

- My preferred form of cardio is a bike machine, which is so easy to me after ten minutes that it doesnt even feel like work. Is it ok to do only one kind of cardio? 
    -(followup) I currently do 35 minutes on ""Level 4"" (out of twelve levels of intensity). My mindset is that I want to built up to 90, but increase very slowly. Is this alright? 

- Furthermore, Should I do cardio before strength training or vice versa? Does it make a difference? 

I think that takes care of all my questions. But like I said, any and all advice concerning weight loss is GREATLY appreciated!

Does anyone think this web idea is viable?,"I had this idea recently after my parents spent a good 6 months going to offices, soliciting bids, and getting quotes for several different remodeling projects in our home. My idea was to try and consolidate this process. while using some basic economic principles to attempt to benefit the consumers, as well as the contractors who perform the job. My idea was an eBay-similar site, where people would post a job they needed done, and various contractors would bid on that job, similar to how big government contracts are auctioned off. The competition would certainly benefit those who need the job, and the contractors would benefit by having major sources of work posted on the site. I talked about it with my parents and they had several criticisms which I gave additional ideas to solve. 

First Problem : How do you make sure bids are from real Contractors?
My Answer : Well, to be able to bid on the site, you would have to be approved by the site as a real contractor, and as you use the site, the reviews from the jobs carried out have to meet a certain positive ratio for them to continue bidding. 

Second Problem : A lot of times contracting jobs need an in depth inspection before a quote can be given.
Answer : For those particular jobs, an ""open house"" can be held, where registered contractors who are interested are given a time and date where they can all inspect a particular site. Then, at a certain time after the ""open house"", bidding begins.

The bids would not be binding like ebay. Contractors could include additional information about their bid and why it should be chosen ahead of the others. This information would be public to all other bidders. After bidding closed, the poster would have time to mull their options and choose a contractor. 

Anyone else think this idea is good? I know it isn't the next big internet thing/multi-million website, but can it get off the ground? If you are really interested, I'd need help starting it up, I'm only 16, and my only programming/web design experience is the AP Comp Sci AB course and designing my club's website. We'd need regional managers to register the contractors in metropolitan areas, as well as a lawyer to draw up the incorporation and terms of service. An idea to get the company started would be to distribute information to local Realtors, who would get a small commission for getting their clients with recently purchased homes or homes to be sold to use the site. 

Thanks ahead of time, reddit!",AskReddit

"Reddit Vets:  My 6 year old cat is ill and I question my vets diagnosis, so can you take a look?","My cat a 6 year old adopted female has had running eyes for the past 3-4 months.  The discharge is usually from the left eye and is usually a greyish or whitish mucus, though sometimes it is yellow/green.  Along with here running eyes she also sneezes a lot.  

We brought her to a local vet 2 weeks ago where she was 9.9lbs and had normal lungs and temperature.  No blood work or xrays were done then.  We were told that due to the lack of eye scars and ulcers it was not feline herpes. Even though her symptoms are directly in line with feline herpes.

The doctor gave her a steroid shot of prednisone as well as two antibiotics(one liquid by mouth and one eye drip).  He also have us 2mg tablets of prednisone to spilt in half and give 2x a day.

We followed the recommended charge and for the first week she still sneezed and still had discharge but it was severely decreased from the normal amounts.  About one exact week after the prednisone shot her eyes started to discharge a lot more and she got kinda blue.  We kept with the antibiotics and the prednisone tabs and then a week after that she got really bad.  This was 3 days ago, she then became extremely congested and didn't even eat or drink for two days.

Yesterday(Sunday the 3rd of the extreme congestion) night we had trouble giving her her prednisone tablet, so we broke it up and put it in sardine juice but she didn't really eat it.  we then took the juice in a baby dropper and have it to her that way, but cant really be 100% sure she got the prednisone(1mg).  Though right before this we gave her sardines and some water and she started to be herself.  The extreme congestion cleared up and she really was good.  Then overnight she got a little more blue, but still much better then those 2 last days.


Today Monday we went to the vet and he took blood and a xray.  Lungs and temperature were normal.  Xray was also completely clean.  Blood tests showed slight leukopenia as well as low levels of creatinine.  Like I said both were not extremely low but low enough for the doctor to take concern. 

My doctor now wants to run thousands of dollars worth of tests and we are just a but unsure.   My cat was much better both physically, mentally and emotionally before we went to see the vet.  We expected Herpes or allergies, but now the doctor is talking about  lymphoma.

I am interested in some other vets takes on this situation, and are low on funds.  The current visits have just about made us broke, and I hope we don't have thousands of dollars left to spend.

Recently, within the past few months, my rectum has been really itchy.  The pattern I've noticed is that when it gets itchy (pretty frequently throughout the day), I'll go to the bathroom and wipe, and there tends to be some fecal matter that's come out.  Now, I wipe thoroughly when I go in the first place.  I've even been using baby wipes as something moist to help make sure everything is as clean as possible.  But this problem persists.

A couple years ago I ended up with what was basically a yeast infection around the same area and I had some Clotrimazole and Betamethasone Dipropionate Cream prescribed, which cleared it up nicely.  This time, using it hasn't really made a difference.  Also, I was on (for an internal yeast infection) diflucan a month or two back for a couple weeks, which would have eradicated any yeast in the area - but the problem still persisted and persists.

Is there something that this could be?  Is it a medical issue?  My health insurance is in a transition phase right now so I'm somewhat at a loss for what to do.

What is your take on automobile insurance?,"My brother and I got in an argument last night over dinner about automobile insurance; he thinks it should be voluntary and practices this belief by not insuring his vehicles at all.

He think that insurance companies are part of a systemic problem in which private companies and public policy intertwine.  Also he labels it as another excuse to impose fines on citizens who don't carry it.

I think that liability insurance should be mandatory (as it currently is), since you are effectively piloting a deadly weapon at high velocity towards other people, and most individuals don't have the means to pay for the cost of accidents in which people are injured.

My final statement was that people who have **enough income** to insure their vehicles and **willfully refuse to insure their vehicles** are not only breaking the law, they are ass holes.  They put other other people in financial jeopardy and push up rates on uninsured and under-insured motorist coverage for everyone who *does* pay for insurance.

Does anyone else have a problem with sleep?,"I have had this problem for about as long as I can remember. Ever since around puberty especially, I started sleeping in as late as I could get away with. I would stay up later and sleep later, progressing through 25-26hour cycles until a reset is forced by an outside force. Today as a 24 year old adult, I have no one to help reset my clock. I will miss obligations, sleep in, and then have to clean up the mess afterwards. Apologize to people, make excuses, lies... its embarassing. Today I slept in until 5:45 p.m. I know that this isn't normal, and I'm tired of letting this cycle continue until I have to once again stay up all night just so I can do things the next morning.

I need help deciding on a laptop/desktop,"Okay, here's my problem.  I've been planning on getting a new desktop for a few years.  Finally luck has smiled upon me and I don't have to buy a hot water heater, or an air conditioner etc.  

In December I bought a laptop for my wife.  At the time I felt she'd have the laptop and I'd eventually have my desktop and we'd be a happy family.  But since my replacement/temporary computer is so slow, I've begun to use her laptop by default.  And I've gotten used to it.  Her laptop isn't anything special: duo core, 3g of ram, 250g of hd.  But there's something to be said for being able to use it while laying next to your sleeping wife, or taking it wherever the kids are and being able to be there and still mess around on the computer.  I kind of like it, actually I love it.  So, my budget is about $1k.  I was going to try and get a refurbed desktop (1tb, 8g+ram, i7 processor, 512mb vid card).  Could I get something close to that for a laptop at that price?  Or am I going to be  kicking myself in a few years?  I want this to last me a while.  But I know I'll need to upgrade it to extend it's life.  I can't be dropping a thousand bucks every year for a new computer.

Backstory: I've never really had a state of the art computer, so I'm used to waiting a few years to play games on the PC anyway.  Plus if there's a game I REALLY want to play and it's on multiple platforms I can play it on my 360 (I know all ports aren't the same etc etc). 

Or, should I get my desktop, and use my wife's laptop when she's not on it?  I would probably have to uninstall steam and all my games when I get my own.

What would you guys who have most likely been through this do?  My gut says get the desktop but I've kinda gotten used to being able to playing medieval II in bed :D.  

tl;dr Need help deciding between laptop and desktop.  Can spend $1k.",AskReddit

* Equipment? I need to get a new pair of running shoes but I have no idea on what to get for a marathon (pretty sure my 3 year old ASICS won't cut it). Watches, recommended brands or specific watches? Anything else?

"Dear Reddit, My neighboor thinks i'm stealing is wifi and want me to pay, what shall i do?","So, since my neighboor isn't cooperative and doesn't know shit about computers, i hope reddit could help me sort this thing out without too much assle.

My roomate is away for a while, so it may continued to use it without me knowing, wich i don't really care, actually. He's a good friend of mine and i can advance him the money to pay his due while he's away. But just for fun, what are my actual option? What can they have against us?

I mean, i don't really care about the money, but the neighbors are a bunch of bitchy girls that i got trouble with: name calling (the walls are thin and they screamed insults at us just for laughs thinking werdidn't know where it was from (yeah...)), the classic music at the max at 3 am, so i really don't have any morals for them.

I will pay if there's nothing to do, but hey, it's worth giving a try; how can i work this out, reddit?

Looking at everything through a non-biased viewpoint, it's hard to believe I lasted this long in this sea of nonsense. And here comes the hard part. I somehow have to tell my hardcore, lifelong Mormon parents. I called my mom today, and she told me how excited she was that my mission was coming up, and how she hoped I would go to Germany, where her mom was from, and all the preparations we would go through, and how proud she was, and I almost started crying.

Can I get a psychiatrist's opinion? Or anyone familiar with mental health.,"Do you think it is possible to be depressed(and unaware of it) for so long that you become accustomed to it and learn to cope with living in a depressed perception of reality?

The world seems so plain and boring to me, but it's not, it's huge and there are unlimited things to interact with in it.

So basically I think that I am normal -&gt; I think the world sucks -&gt; the world sucks(because that's how I perceive it.)

The reality of it is - I am depressed &gt;ROADBLOCK DO NOT PROCEED&lt; the world is great and I am happy

The roadblock is the depressed state of mind preventing me from perceiving the normal reality, and the fact that I think I am normal is preventing me from denying this sucky 'reality' which sustains my depressed state of mind.

Does this make sense? Is it possible to be depressed for so long that you are convinced that depressed = normal?

&gt;Also, another thing to add on; How large of an effect can depression have on the way you feel about life? In additionnnnn, when I say accustomed to it I mean that I don't typically appear to be depressed, like I am able to enjoy myself semi-frequently, and I desire to do things.",AskReddit

I did not choose the CS route because I started college after the dot-com bubble. I did not want to be living on the streets either by majoring in sociology.

Can anyone give me advice on patenting and related issues?,"Yes, this is a repost, but I'm hoping to get some more advice- only one person responded the last time. :_(

A while ago I came up with an idea for a useful little tech device that I'd never seen in stores. After doing a little research, it seems like no one's made anything comparable (if it seems like I'm being vague, it's intentional- it's probably unreasonably paranoid, but I hate to divulge details for fear of patent-jacking).

I suppose my question is- what's next? Do I patent the idea? It seems like patents are ridiculously expensive to get, and I don't know exactly what's required for doing so. After patenting it, would it be easier/more profitable to sell the idea to someone who can easily produce it, or try and market/produce it myself with a business partner? It would require programming experience I don't have, for one thing.

I guess just any kind of general advice for patenting/marketing an invention would be good. I'll answer any questions as best I can.

Dear Reddit: How does one make friends!?,"Dear Reddit,

I just got my first real job ever, it's in San Francisco.  The only problem is that I grew up in NY, went to college in PA, and moved back home to NY after graduation for an internship.  So essentially, I don't know anyone or anything in SF.

I've never had problems making friends, and I have a good group of friends at home and from college.  But this isn't college - I'm going to be busy working!   The job is at a tech startup with only two other guys, who are older, and probably not material that I'd want be making good-buddies-to-go-out-drinking-every-weekend with.

So Reddit, what do you all suggest I do?  

If any of you live in San Francisco and would like to be my friend, let me know!  I'm a 23 year dude, ex-college athlete (wrestling), I love video games, movies, getting drunk, tech-geeky stuff, football, being active, and generally just having a good time.  I'm easy going, I never get into fights with anyone, and I just want to be able to meet people to hang out with.

**tl;dr** I'm moving to a city I've never been to before for a job.  I don't know anyone there, and the people I'll be working with are probably not the best bet for me to be hanging out with on weekends.

How do I go about making friends!?

Who's to blame for the financial collapse?,"Democrats and Republicans, liberals and conservatives have each had their own ideas of who to blame for the financial crisis.  Until tonight I've been on the Democrat's/liberal's side which says that there hasn't been enough regulation of the banking industry.  My understanding of the financial crisis has been that it was a ""perfect storm.""  Banks were handing out NINA(No Income No Assets) loans, selling them to other banks who then chopped them up and repackaged them as mortgage backed securities(MBS) with AAA ratings.  It was only a matter of time before people who had no job and no assets could not repay their mortgages, and it's no surprise then that these types of activities eventually led to a crash.  

Until tonight I thought that these practices were allowed because nobody told banks not to do it, and banks were simply acting in their own(albeit short-term) interest.  But now I think I was wrong.  Fanny Mae and Freddie Mac were both organizations set up by the US government]( to encourage people to purchase homes.  Originally they were strictly a government organization, however eventually they were allowed to be publicly traded companies looking to make a profit, and they were not accountable to the SEC since they still enjoyed the backing of the federal government.  They used their ability to take out low interest loans to buy up mortgages from other banks, making a profit from the difference in interest rates and also by selling MBS.  This provided an incentive for other banks to hand out more mortgages since they could just sell them to Fannie and Freddie(Fannie/Freddie owned 90% of the mortgages on the market).  When people inevitably started defaulting on their loans, Fannie and Freddie [went under]( and the MBS's lost their value.  This caused a cascade of [credit default swap(CDS) payments to be triggered since they had been purchased as a hedge for the MBS's.  AIG supplied the largest share of CDS, and they simply could not pay out.  Banks lost all value of the MBS and the CDS hedge didn't pan out causing the whole financial industry to teeter on the edge of collapse.

So, now I'm wondering how is this not directly the fault of our government for allowing Fannie and Freddie to exist in this way in the first place?  While the lack of regulation and transparent exchange of CDS's is a problem and has gotten a whole lot of attention, it seems like it was far from the underlying problem which was actually handing out all these mortgages in the first place.  And since this is not happening anymore, haven't we by and large removed the systemic risk?  If we have, I'm now wondering how big a deal this whole ""too big to fail"" business really is since they wouldn't have failed if our government hadn't allowed the mortgage bubble to happen in the first place.

Reddit, what are your thoughts on all of this?  There is a lot of anger out there directed at the banking sector, but now I can't help but wonder if it's very unfair to blame them given everything I've mentioned above.",AskReddit

Mathematical problem - I need help!,"So i've been thinking of this problem for some time, and need it explained once and for all.

You have a coin that you flip and for the purposes of this example there's a 50% chance it'll land on either side.

Suppose you flip it and 10 times in a row it comes up heads. Amazing! Extremely unlikely and amazing for that reason. However you say to yourself, i built this coin so that it was even, so over time (t-&gt; infinity) I would expect this system to output even results (50% to both sides).

So can I assume as time passes (and slowly approaches infinity) there will be a 'pressure' to enforce this balancing out? I know the end results of an infinite experiment, so suppose i'm half way through (inifinty/2) and i'm still just getting heads. On each individual throw I know that my chances are 50% for each side, but sooner or later for these results to average out i'll need to start getting tails. At that point in time am I any more or less likely to get tails, based on the history of the throw?

I Just had a dream with Natalie Portman in it. Anybody want to hear / analyze?,"I (male) found myself in a cabin with several other people I know, and several female celebrities.

I ran outside and looked in all directions even running up streets in the 2 or 3 day old snow. I came back and everyone was preparing to go. I wasn't confident we'd find a place. 

We all sat in a multi car golf cart similar to a theme park tram and headed off. Passing a shopping center that I somehow hadn't seen we turn in to a massive food court. Instead of the large box stores there are individual food court style restaurants. I, of course, am wondering how Natalie is doing. She seems okay, cross-legged and somber. We turn into a mexican-themed ""store"" and, still driving, are able to read a large menu and follow paths to different departments. We arrive in one of the fancier sections were all they serve is bananas, rock salt, and assorted sauces. It's packed and in a frenzy of waiters emphatically suggesting dishes and cleaning about. Natalie seems satisfied but I have no further conversation with her. The last thing I remember was coming to a table that hadn't been cleaned yet. The only thing left to clear was a scattering of chalky rock salt. I took it upon myself to sweep it off and was carefully catching it when a male Latino waiter approached saying ""No, no (sweeping to the carpeted floor with a flat scraper) this is what we do."" I looked at him, somewhat handsome if I must describe. He said, ""This is how we clean. It is to sanitize the floor."" I looked again at him and said ""Genius"". &lt;/Dream&gt;

Is there any way to get out from under a HOA?,"In short my HOA sucks hard.
Ive been living in my town house that for 6 years. The HOA fee started at $145 and is now up to $190. They raise the fee each year.
Which wouldn't grind my gears but...
They don't even open the pool anymore because they cant afford it.
The tennis court and basketball court are long over grown with vegetation and not even close to being usable.
I have like a 1ft by 3ft piece of grass which i guess they maintain and besides putting away money for other things, i feel like im paying them $190 a month to mow that patch.
The community looks like crap. They aren't keeping up with maintenance on peoples houses.
Now they want an extra $300 this year from everyone because they town raised the water rates.
I think paying these guys about $2000 a year to do nothing is a bit much.
Yes, i know they probably reroof the house at some point. But the way they do things, when they have to do that, they are going to say they dont have the money and are going to ask for more money.

Plus, it seems to me, they keep raising the damn HOA fee, then more people dont pay it because they cant afford it, so they raise the HOA fee again to cover the people who don't pay it.. and then circle continues.
And who the hell would move into somewhere where the HOA fee is $190?  Nobody. SO, to cover the costs of those empty units, guess what they do? Raise the HOA fee.

The only thing these guys have done for me is send me threatening letters because my neighbors dog shit on my lawn and I didnt clean it up (isnt that what im paying them for?).

I have been with the same lady for just about 4 years now. Every V-day, I've tried to do something thoughtful for my lady that is within my means. Now, I’m not rich or anything but I try to be different without being too over the top. I've done the dozen roses at work, nice dinners and last year I surprised her with a new kitty. 

This year I have a lot in the way of finances to consider and so the budget isn't very high... I would love to definitely stay well under the $100 mark (going on vacation for the first time in 3 years at the end of the month!). Anyway, I would love to hear suggestions on what to do this year or even some of your past experiences. I always strive to do something that she wouldn’t expect, something different that makes her feel like the only woman in the world. You know, like a princess. Help me knock her off her feet this year! 

*Note: We have had a slightly rough patch a few days ago that we’re trying to get through and doing this right would really be great step in the right direction to forgetting our little tiff.

Thanks for taking the time to read this and helping me out.

Cheers,",AskReddit
Has anyone taken a solo vacation? Where did you go?,"In about a month, I'll be going on a week-long solo road trip to Minneapolis, probably Detroit, and then Pittsburgh. I'll be seeing people along the way, but at the end of the day it is a solo road trip. None of my friends wanted to go and do what I want to do, so I'm doing it myself.

I'll be spending 5 days in Pittsburgh, going to 2 Penguins games, and hopefully meeting up with someone there at some point, but I'm trying to figure out how to spend my time there. I'll have to find a gym to go to for a few days (triathlon training) and I'll have plenty of books along and my laptop for writing. Otherwise, I plan on visiting museums and restaurants and doing a lot of tooling around.

Who else has done this? What did you do with all of your time?",AskReddit

Can someone give me a cheaper alternative to satellite internet?,"I live out in the middle of nowhere. I am forced to use and iphone for internet and that is amazingly slow because I don't receive 3G or a consistent EDGE signal. I was looking at this product I found on google called Proxicast but I'm looking for 3G speeds. Austin ( approx. 50 miles) has 3G and I believe Killeen (approx. 30 miles does) does too. My main question is would this be a sufficient solution if I added an antenna or something similar? I figure it would be cheaper to purchase internet access from a cell phone company than satellite. 
If anyone has any other suggestions please suggest away.

"Reddit, help me figure out the most efficient way to shovel my oddly-shaped driveway!","So, we got a whole bunch of snow last night and it kind of sucks to shovel it. I have an oddly-shaped driveway and shoveling it can be a difficult endeavor. 
Here is an approximation of how the driveway looks. 
Here it is with a grid for easier description.

I frequently shovel from C1 to C4 (down the middle) and then go outwards from there, but when we get a lot of snow (a foot or so, like this morning) that can involve a lot of snow-throwing which is murder on my back.

So, do you guys have any ideas? I only have a manual shovel--a snowblower would be too expensive. Keep in mind that if I push the snow too far, it leaks over the side of the shovel and leaves lines of snow on either side where I'm pushing.

Dear Reddit: So I work in a fast food sandwich shop...,"I've been working this minimum-wage job for more than two years now. It's an easy job - making sandwiches. The shop has a retro feel to it, with lots of old school decor and live music. During the time that I've been there, there has been more than 100% turnover of both employees and managers - we've gone through two GMs and more than six managers and assistant managers, not to mention the entire store's worth of employees more than once.

It's not hard to be good at your job - like I said before, it's just making sandwiches. I can truthfully say that I am more than competent.

So, here's some details about the situation:

1.) During 2009, the company did not give raises to employees. At all.

2.) For much of the time I worked at the store, my girlfriend also worked at the same store. I was considered unpromotable because of this because of a story policy regarding couples. Neither of us could be promoted because one of us could potentially abuse our authority. She since left; she was hired in as a manager elsewhere.

3.) I've been in the process of being trained for a higher positon since last July - the process was started then and on average, takes two weeks.

4.) My final paperwork has been awaiting completion for a month and a half at this point.

5.) I have very strong feelings that the manager responsible for the paperwork, etc., is deliberately procrastinating out of a personal dislike. He is also in charge of the scheduling, and cuts my hours whenever he can.

Help! What can I do in this situation? Finding a new job is an option, but I'm poor and paying for school and looking for work in my area is very difficult - especially because I haven't finished school yet and have very little in the way of qualifications because of it. The alternatives are just other minimum-wage fast food jobs, and I'm unlikely to get the same kind of hours and the odds of me being able to hire in as a manager are slim to none without any experience (which is what I'm trying to get).

My ex-girlfriend wants me back the same day her new boyfriend dumped her. Would it be cruel to tell her my opinion of her?,"We dated for 4 and a half years. We got along really well, but she was pretty self-absorbed. We'd spend half or most of our time talking about her problems, insecurities, etc. She'd get upset otherwise. I sometimes thought about breaking up, but never did because I didn't want to hurt her.

But then, she meets a guy and doesn't tell me about him until she was sure they had something going, and she breaks up with me. She then shuts me out of her life. I was honestly depressed for a few good months, but she refused to help. Called me a couple of times to talk about herself. I felt stupid and used. But I pulled myself out of the mud. I learned a lesson the hard way.

Then, she starts emailing me. Apparently, her boyfriend won't tolerate her emotional outbursts, mood swings, insecurities and broke up with her. The same day, she says how it was such a mistake to let me go, how I was the best guy that she could find. I agreed to talk to her, but I would never want a relationship again. She's rationalized things to a degree where she thinks everything she did was perfectly justified.

Now, I can do two things. I can be the bigger person and plainly tell her that she's going to have to move on. Or, I could tell her what I think of her. I won't throw insults at her or anything, I'm just going to say ""I hope you realized that you've lost me because you're so self-absorbed. You treat people terribly. I don't love you at all anymore."" I doubt she's going to learn anything from this, but it would certainly make my chest lighter to tell her how bad she is. What would you do?

Edit: Thanks Reddit. I didn't expect that this would get very many replies, but since you've taken the time to write to me, I've read every comment. I just wanted to mention, before I wrote this, I had been ignoring her for a while, and was wondering if there was anything I should do to stop her from trying to get in touch with me. Anyway, I just kept ignoring her. The emails and messages have not stopped, but they have slowed. I'm just going to leave it at that. I've realized (from advice of friends, your comments) that leaving her hanging is probably the thing that bothers her the most.",AskReddit

Dear Reddit: I've had an embarrassing sexual problem (premature) for a while and maybe Reddit can help me.,"Okay, here we go.  So I've got this problem, it's weird.  Anytime I have a sexual encounter with a woman, it's like i get anxiety or something.  I get very nervous and my heart starts beating very quickly.  If I have intercourse, I will always cum within 1 minute, usually less.  I can't figure out why, I've tried masturbating before like 100 times before meeting up with a girl and all that  does is reduce my sex drive without solving the problem.  I can take hand jobs or blow jobs, but once it hits the pussy, BOOM!

During my first sexual experience at 16, I lasted for a solid 2 hours, but every single time after that has been this same problem.  The only things that have every worked for me are illicit drugs, particularly ecstasy and opiates.  I'm no longer willing to use those drugs anymore, but also I don't want to have to get fucked up to be able to have sex with a girl.

I've considered purchasing desensitizing lotion or spray or something, has anyone ever done that?  Was it effective?  This whole problem really fucks up my head too cuz it makes it difficult for me to maintain the confidence to approach women knowing that I won't be able to satisfy them with my dick.  I can eat pussy, but let's face it, women want to get fucked.  I've also heard of those excercises where your supposed to masturbate until your about to cum and stop and squeeze, and although I never continued with it for a long period of time, i dont feel like that helps.

Some nights I can't even walk to the toilet without extreme agony. (I get cuts in the soles of my feet... one under the small toe, one under the big toe and two at the very back of my foot). You know how paper cuts tend to hurt? Imagine that about 2x bigger and deeper. (e.g. your toe is hanging on by a thread)

The problem tends to be when I get into bed at night, to relax and sleep. That's when they start burning up (you can feel heat streaming off) and becoming extremely irratated. It's insane, and fucking annoying.

Then one day, I was prescribed Zopiclone and my feet really nearly healed up. I was so happy, I actually went out and did stuff with friends and the works. Ended up with a girlfriend too. But that was all short lived... now they've just progressively been getting worse. I've tried (for treating the symptoms): 

* Clonidine

* Clonazepam

* Promethazine (sedating antihistamine)

* Topiramite

* Hydromorphone

* Oxycodone / OxyNorm

* Morphine

* Nefopam hydrochloride (Acupan)

* Amitriptyline

* Gabbapentin

* Diazepam

* Tramadol

* Codiene / Paracetamol 

* (and basically every cream under the sun)

I have some weird genetic fuck-up too, where low-dosages of anything just fail rediculously. With that medication list, the only ones that helped (they work for a max of 2 weeks) was Clonidine, Acupan and Diazepam (this only lasted several days). The other more stronger ones like Oxy took some edge off... and made me feel pretty moody/depressed a lot. I was on that for 3 months and then stopped completely. For some reason, I don't get withdrawals. I think that's because of my genetic tolerence or whatever it is.

My question to you Reddit - what the shit do I do? :( I've been to multiple doctors, dermatoligists, pain clinics ... yesterday my doctor told me she had no idea what to do now. Does anybody have any idea of other medication that could work? Or something alternative?(salt water at the beach doesn't help).

Reddit: Can you help me identify a mid-90s cyborg/space cartoon?,"When I was in grade school I remember frequently renting the same video just about every weekend for a couple of months from the local video store.

Reddit is a website where people communicate with written text.  The only way censorship takes place over the internet is when someone declines to post an idea or concept, however frivolous, because they're afraid its expression will offend someone.

I just voted on a Diebold in the Illinois state elections. Do these machines give printouts b/c I didn't get one?,"I voted electronically because I've never done it before and wanted to see how these machines worked. I was given an electronic card to put into the machine. The actual machine was pretty easy to use and clear to follow, right until the end. It kept on going through verification screens and saying something about printing for me to re-insure that I was voting for who I wanted to. The machine also started making a whirring noise, like a fax machine or something, towards the end, so I thought I would be getting a physical printout. However, it ended up going back to the default screen and spit the electronic card out. When I asked around, the workers said the machine won't give a printout (I don't know if that meant it doesn't normally or it had a printing problem). Suspiciously enough, the whirring noise continued after I left the machine and the next person started using it, which makes me think something was broken.

**TLDR: The machine made the impression it was giving a printout but ended up not doing so. I just wanted to ask you guys if you know anything about Diebold machines and printouts, because my experience was sketchy as f*ck.**

What is your morning routine?,"I know some people have the standard morning - get up, shower, eat breakfast, leave. Mine is a little bit more complex than that.

Right now I'm 16 (male) and a junior in high school.

My lunch has always been an important part of my life - I like to have the best lunch possible, with fresh ingredients. This year, I've been making a very elaborate lunch. At night, I'll make egg rolls for myself, cut up ~3-5 different vegetables, cook shrimp, and set my the timer on my rice maker for the next morning. This takes around 20-45 minutes, depending on how elaborate I want my lunch to be. Then I go to bed, with a newly cleaned towel on my pillow.

After waking up, I have a 20-30 minute workout (stretching, ab work, cardio). I also drink about half a liter of water to help me wake up. Once I'm thoroughly worked out, I come upstairs and take the rice out of the rice maker, so that it can cool down a little bit before I have to deal with it. I don't like really cold vegetables/eggs either, so I take those out of the fridge. Once I'm ready to make my lunch, I go have a shower. I wash my hair every 2-4 days, and condition a bit more often. I eventually get out of the shower, towel off, and get dressed.

At this point, I go to make my lunch. I cut up my egg roll into pieces, and put most of the rice into my lunch container with the egg rolls. I use the rest of the rice to make sushi (yes, I have sushi every single day that I have school) and put that and the vegetables into my lunch container. If I have time, this is when I'd eat breakfast - cereal and a banana.

With only about 25 minutes until I have to leave, I go and do my hair, which takes about 15-20 minutes. I brush my teeth, get my stuff ready, and eventually I go to school.

Re: I'm a pastor who is writing a sermon ... Your question is mute/irrelevant. Fellow redditors is this not definitive proof he is full of it?!?!!!,"Re: I'm a pastor who is writing a sermon ... Your question is mute/irrelevant. Fellow redditors is this not definitive proof he is full of it?!?!!!


PREAMBLE:
By narrowing the topic to the contemporary church you seek to avoid the most damming reason to confront you!

I am a scientist and as such I determine all things based on only the measurable proof available. Since there is no measurable proof for or against god existing it is a futile proposition to even discus this. However there is room to look at the value of Christianity it self in contrast to other religious options. To see the value of some thing by the good or bad that is the end result seams very intuitively obvious to me. The measurable proof I prepose to use is DEAD BODIES. 

ARGUMENT:
To do this we must start at the beginning of religious awakening and make a rough estimate of peoples killed at the hands of each of the ""big four"" as we move forward in time towards today. The ""big four"" I speak of are the three Western religions: Judaism, Islam and Christianity plus the main Eastern: Buddhism. 

At The beginning of the common era we see Judaism is by it's own account well on it's way having built up several city states worth of genocide documented in the Old Testament. Conservatively this could be a starting count of four thousand (4000). Islam, Christianity and Buddhism are just starting at around this time and so we will say they are at a count of Null (0). 

Judaism is under control of Roam and so is powerless to cause blood shed at this time (Judaism +0). Islam is a religion born out of killing as the main strategy to gain control implemented by Muhammad was to take power over the trade routs of the Arab peninsula by force (Islam +2000). Christianity started less violently by most accounts (Christianity +0). Buddhism has a main teaching to harm non and dose well at this time to follow it (Buddhism +0). This gives us a count of Judaism 4000, Islam 2000, Christianity 0 and Buddhism 0.

Judaism passed from Roman control to Persian control then was sent into diaspora without much of a fight(Judaism +0). The next notable killing event is the spread of Islam and Christianity culminating with the Crusades (Islam +3000, Christianity +4000). The extra 1000 for Christianity is for the killing of their own fellow Christians at Constantinople by the Roman Catholics. Buddhism spread rather painlessly (Buddhism +0). From this (arguably uneducated) guess we now have a count of Judaism 4000, Islam 5000, Christianity 4000 and Buddhism 0.

Judaism was still in diaspora for the duration of the Inquisitions(Judaism +0). Islam was becoming more fanatical and was more forceful in taking land in the north as Constantinople fell along with substantial amounts of land (Islam +1000). However Christianity is now beginning to show it's true colors as it spirals into a blood thirsty global rampage known as the Spanish Inquisition (Christianity +10,000). The Buddhism movement sees now it's only great shame when Hindu temples and the Hindus them selves are attacked in Northern India in retaliation for earlier transgression (Buddhism +1000). Our uneducated guess is now a count of Judaism 4000, Islam 6000, Christianity 14000 and Buddhism 1000.

CONCLUSION:
We can go on but the numbers will just keep getting bigger. However we now have all the proof we need. Religion is to a greater or lesser degree BAD depending what one you pick.",AskReddit

Did anybody do poorly in college and then get their shit together in time to get a decent GPA?,"Throwaway for obvious reasons. I'm just going to sum it up:

* I'm really depressed, like don't get out of bed *at least* 2 days a week depressed.

* I left for college a year early and got a little under a 3.0. I transferred schools to escape a crappy home situation (I was commuting). I've been living at school for 2 semesters. 

* Last semester I withdrew but I was not doing well at all.

* I just failed my first exam in a class for my major.

I don't really know what to do. None of this is an excuse for my grades, but it is the reason, and I want to fix them and my situation. Has anyone in my situation turned out okay? I don't want to drop out of school. Sadly, I love school. But I also don't want to waste other people's time and money. 

Basically, it's not that I don't know how to do well. In high school I had a 3.7 or so and I was still really depressed and didn't go to school a lot (physically or mentally), but naturally college is different.

Reading the comments on this post inspired me to right this. 

I am no casanova, but I do have fairly good game. Something I have come to realize lately is this is because I am comfortable while talking to ladies. The key to hitting on a lady, is NOT hitting on a lady (unless she gives you clear signs). By NOT hitting on a lady, you have no ulterior motives and thus should be capable of having a perfectly comfortable conversation. The better you can do this, the more comfortable woman will be with you and vice-versa.

Also, remember, have fun! If you are talking to a beautiful woman there is no reason you should be scared or nervous. Just be happy she is talking to you and have fun even if she won't fuck you.

What is the most 'asshole-ish' thing anyone has ever done to you?,"In 2000, I was very lucky to be able to afford (for the first time in my life) to buy a car that didn't suck balls. I bought what was my dream car. 

Two days later I am (with g/f in tow &amp; her horrid mother squished into the absurdly tiny seat in the back - *that bit was ok*:) sitting at a red light waiting for it to change. A bus driver wants to get into the turning lane beside me but can't because there is no room for either of us to move forward, gets impatient and tries to *gently* sneak past. He failed. Miserably. 

I get out of the car and start yelling (while inside my soul was crying FUCKER!!! YOU FUCKED MY SHIT!!! ) to please stop (I was very calm and controlled) and informed him that he hit me. I walked over to his window and told him he has hit me and that he should stop around the corner. 

We stop, I have a big dent/scratch all down the side of my car. So far, all very grown up and sensible. 

He refuses to give me his name, he will not show his license, or provide me with any details what so ever. He just shrugs, turns around, and starts the bus us again. (oh btw - the bus is empty). My Girlfriend and I jump on before he can shut the doors. I jump off to call the police because he won't give me his name/insurance/*anything*. He shuts the doors and takes off down the road. With my girlfriend still on board. A few hundred feet down the road, he opens the door and lets her off. 

So I get home, and call my insurance company. Fucking bus company were fuckers; first they denied it. Then they confirmed that it happened, but said that it was ""my fault"" (I was completely stationary at the time). 

Then they claimed that my two witnesses (g/f and freakshow mother) didn't count, I needed *independant witnesses*... bugger. 

Eventually they tied it up so long that my insurance tripled because of the unresolved claim, meanwhile was being forced to drive around with it still damaged (it only superficial damage, nothing serious) because the insurance company would not authorize repair until the claim was resolved.

"Dear Reddit, I'm scared I might be turning racist. Please help. Are black people generally ruder then the rest of the population?","Ok so here is my story..
About a year ago I moved to London for a job offer a found hard to refuse. For whose who have never experienced it London is a very chaotic place, especially during rush hour and people tend to push shove and generally barge all over the place - this would happen to me several times daily. After a while I began to notice that it was mainly black people that would be pushing / barging past me. 
I was horrified that I thought this as I consider myself very liberal, and put it down to confirmation bias or some such once I had gotten then idea in my head. So I decided to carry a notebook around and tally all the instances of rudeness (convinced it would show an even spread of races). I even developed specific criteria for ""rudeness"" - all non verbal. The results showed about 70% of my rude ""interactions"" came from Black people. 
I am now utterly utterly terrified that I am turning into a racist. Please help!!! Has anyone else experienced a similar thing? Do black people tend to find White people ruder to them?? Perhaps it is something to do with where I live, how I act?  I'm so ashamed of myself.",AskReddit

Does anyone else feel like they are a chameleon of life?,"Growing up, I moved quite often.  I always had new sets of friends, new bullies.. a new group of a-holes to suck up to.  I found myself with new interests as the years went by, basically interests my friends already had and I would take them on as my own.  One prime example - I had this friend in middle school, and she really loved Mariah Carey.  I know, I know... anyway, I decided to start listening and decided I liked her too.  So, one day this girl told me she had a crush on a guy, and I told the guy.  She got so livid that she wrote me a 4 page letter describing how I just copied her and I am an idiot and not even her friend.  This note really got me thinking... even at 13!  (She's still single, btw).

Now that I am pushing 30, I realize that I still do this.  I don't have any particular hobbies besides working and hanging out with my friends and whatnot.  When I am around certain groups of people, I find myself chiming in on discussion with interest, i.e. local bands, politics, etc.  I personally couldn't care less about most of these things.  It's like I am just this being who goes around talking to people like I know WTF I am talking about, that I have an interest in crap people like.  All I really want is to be like all my high school class and get married and have a couple of kids, but until then I just suck it up and BS about stupid things, and work my butt off as I wait for that future.

I recently applied to a big web hosting company to work in their design and user experience department. Interviews have gone well, and it looks like it might be heading toward a job offer.

The problem: During my interview, I asked my interviewers if my having my own web design business would be a conflict of interest in their opinion. They only offer web hosting and templated websites (no custom website building). They referred me to the HR rep who told me *it was*.

I'm very disappointed because this job would be a great opportunity for me to get some real time in the industry doing web design and programming.

Is it OK to make up gossip from nowhere?,"It appears that gossip is an evolutionary social glue.  According to the article:

&gt;In many instances, the goal of gossip is not truth or accuracy. What matters is the bond that gossiping can forge, often at the expense of a third party.

So my question, then, is this: is it OK to totally make up (to lie, to invent) gossip?  By this I don't mean to make up gossip about people, but to make up people for the sake of gossip.

It's not like I want to justify lying, necessarily, but I want the benefits of gossip without all the mess; and it seems like inventing characters and their stories - just not letting people know their invented - is a pretty easy way to go about it.  Question is: is this justifiable?

"Reddit, what songs did you listen to growing up that have special meaning to you now? Also have you relistended to any songs form your youth and now better understand what the lyrics meant?","I've always enjoyed music, but I've just recently started listening to my playlists at work and I suppose I'm having a nostalgic moment. So I'd like to share a few of my musical memories with you.

""Smells like teen spirit"" by Nirvana - reminds me of this girl I tried to impress in 8th grade. I had just moved to Charlotte and it was the start of the year so to get us all acquainted, the teacher had asked us to make this origami ball and write all of our interests on it. I looked at the girl in all of her grunge glory and wrote ""Nirvana."" Well I suppose she was still mourning the loss of Kurt pretty hard and gave me the absolute evilest looking glare I'd ever seen. We never talked again, but she didn't really ever talk anyway.

""Sex and Candy"" by Marcy Playground  - reminds me of the first girl I ever hooked up with. She loved the song and after listening to it, we both got the inclination to give it a try. I always get solemn when I think about her. She was a very smart girl who got in with the wrong crowd after i moved away. She ended up on drugs and with 2 kids last time I saw her about 10 years ago.

""Hang"" by MB20 - I actually found this song in college, it just stuck with me. I didn't get the hang of college the first go round and didnt connect with most of the other kids. I remember listening to this one on many a lone weekend nights.

""Jeremiah was a bullfrog"" by CCR- There was this kid in 7th grade named Jeremy, the entire class would break into song nearly every time someone said his name.

""Goonies R Good Enough"" by Cindy Lauper - reminds me of my childhood. We lived in a small trailer park adjacent to huge sand dunes and the intracoastal waterway. We would be be pirates and go find ""treasure"" (junk) around the dunes and ride (sink) our bikes over the dunes.


For the second part, which started me thinking today. I was listening to ""what's the story morning glory"" by Oasis - another song with nostalgia and heard a cocaine refernce ""chained to the mirror and a razorblade"" and it just sort of clicked, I hadn't ever thought about what it meant before.

""Brick"" is another one. I heard it again a few years back and thought it was about abortion. So I googled it and low and behold, it is, and Ben Folds has a very personal story on it.

20 Things:  Life Advice by Reddit,"So I was reading the 20 things at age 20 and realized there was a lot of good advice in it.  

I think that initial project could be taken to the next level if we could create a reddit E-book around it.  Basically, the list from the original AskReddit would be the skeleton of the book, and it would contain vignettes from the Reddit community illustrating why it is good advice, how to implement the advice, how your life has changed because of that advice, or just thoughts on why it is important.   

Ideally, a little more thought would go into the vignettes than a typical reddit post, but I envision a final product that illustrates the collective wisdom of the Reddit community.  And it doesn't have to be just Reddit narratives.  It can be anything that can be captured on the printed page:  drawings, comics, photographs, snippets from articles.  The possibilities are endless.  

But I really do think that 20 things post could be the start of something really cool and tangible from the Reddit community.  

I have set up an e-mail address for people to submit contributions if this thing actually takes off.  RedditLifeAdvice@gmail.com.

I am more than happy to help get the ball rolling, but would love the help of others when it actually comes to putting this thing together.   

So yeah.  Thoughts/Questions/Comments/Criticisms/Hopes/Dreams/Aspirations/Other feedback is greatly appreciated.

"Hey Reddit, does anyone know the consequences of walking away from a mortgage in the Netherlands?","I have googled the hell out of this one and have yet to find any useful info, so I am hoping to tap in to the hivemind and get some advice from Redditors. At some point we might need to get professional advice, but I'm hoping someone can just tell me if this is a stupid idea and if not, point me in the right direction.

A while ago I fell in love with a Dutch girl who lives in Rotterdam. As I live in London, this is somewhat problematic. We have reached the point now where we would like to try living together and agreed that her moving to London is the best thing (she speaks perfect English, I can say ""stroopwafels"", ""weit"" and ""Ik hou van je"" - useful, but not really enough for the work environment).

The problem is she owns a house with an ex-boyfriend, on which she pays 50% of the mortgage and necessary bills (taxes and whatnot). The Dutch housing market is enjoying the same fortunes as pretty much everywhere else so it is just sitting vacant until someone buys it. The mortgage is now higher than the value of the house so even if it sells tomorrow she will still owe about 20,000 EUR (the short-fall, plus admin fees that were put on top of the mortgage). Her share of the bills/mortgage payments come to around 750EUR per month. I see this as wasted money as she is never going to finish paying the mortgage or profit from the sale of the house.

Some people in the UK have said that if they were in that situation here they would just walk away and let the house get repossessed. I am trying to find out if this is a possible option in the Netherlands, as I think it makes sense - even if she sells the house, she will still owe loads of money, so why not let it get repossessed? Then (in my theory) she will just be left with the admin fees, which she would be stuck with even if the house sold. She could then come and live with me in London, and stop throwing 750EUR down the drain.

So, I guess my question is, does anyone know whether or not this is a good idea? I barely know anything about the UK mortgage market and nothing about the Dutch one, so it might completely stupid for all I know. What would you guys do in this situation?

"Hey Reddit, am I straight?","Hey everyone on reddit, I have a question.  Am I straight?  I have a girlfriend I have been dating for 5 years, she is wonderful and I find her incredibly attractive, however I find transgendered women very attractive also.   I find transgendered woman to be as sexy or sexier than most women.  I on the other hand do not find men to be attractive, and cringe on the thought.   As weird as it might sound I find a penis on a transgendered woman to be more appealing than a vagina on a normal woman.   I don't want to be on the bottom of a situation like that but I do find my self thinking that a penis is more attractive. (but only on a transgendered woman) make sense?

So as you can see I am not sure if I am straight, I don't consider my self bi, or gay so how should I label my self?   I guess it is a fetish, but I could actually find my self falling in love with a transgendered woman, just like I could fall in love with any woman.  (so it goes farther than just sexual attraction)...  So what do you think?

Help with huge decision...thinking of relocating to paris after divorce.,"I need some advice reddit.. last year i decided that enough was enough and i went back to school to study for a career change.  This caused my wife to leave me and basically 2009 was a bit shit.  I am now back in my old job, which i hate, living like a student and stuck in the fucking rat race again.. only this time minus one wife.

I live in Ireland and want to move to Paris for a fresh start, but im really clueless how to start!  I have given this a lot of thought as I've always wanted to live in France, and i believe this is the best chance i will get to take the leap. There is no chance of reconciliation with my wife (i wouldn't want too anyway). 

I can speak high school french and am learning more, but i really need some advice on how to get a job and get started in Paris... 

I have worked in IT since leaving school, im now 28, i have lots of experience with respected company but only basic qualifications (MCP, A+, certificates in ICT).   

I guess the big questions are .. 

1)  Will it be difficult for me to find an IT job in paris give that i speak only basic French atm and have no degree?

2)  I have a dog, a german shepherd, will i be able to rent in paris with him? (its hard to find landlords here that are pet friendly)

3) Any hints/tips from people who have done something similar? how did it work out for you guys/gals ?

What could I do to stay concentrated?,"Dear Reddit:

I found myself really hard to concentrate on working lately. I'm a freshmen at a really prestigious college and while I'm excelling academically, I think I'm not doing as good as I could. For example, for more than one of my classes last semester I could've gotten an A, but because of the loss of concentration I didn't finish some assignments and that just cost my letter grade off to a B. 

This semester I got enrolled into the Honors College and the coursework just almost doubled (from 6 to 11 classes, three of which are major classes, because I finished the core while I was in high school). On one hand I don't want to be on the thin ice like last semester but yet I can't help myself to concentrate on my work.

The man I love called me to tell me I'm a horrible person after ignoring me for 6 months,"We dated for 3 years in a long distance relationship. The distance was painful, so I finally decide that it would be mentally healthier for me to break up with him. I start a new relationship, but my ex takes it really hard, but I couldn't help while trying to get over him without it being terrible for me. We end up getting together a few times. We remain good friends, email/ call regularly. We still loved each other and hoped it could work out in the future. He later starts a new relationship, too.

But then, my boyfriend says he could be interested in this other girl if he got to know her better. I am in no way ok with this, things go downhill over the next few months (mismatched personalities), and we break up. I was lonely, going through a hard time and call my ex for guidance. I start thinking he was probably the best for me, and I miss him terribly. I call him more. He's friendly, but not as affectionate. One day, he says he doesn't want us to say ""I love you"" anymore (even though we've been saying it this whole time) because of his girlfriend.

I'm hurt. I felt us drifting, so I make plans to fly out and see him. I try to work a plan with him to be together in the future. He's cold about this and says later that I shouldn't call anymore because I bother his girlfriend. A few emails later, he disappears for months. I email him, call him, text him, tell him how angry/hurt I am. No response. Then his girlfriend calls me, asking for my thoughts. I politely told her that I was *not* a threat to her; if I was going to start a relationship with him, it would be a year or more from then, when he graduated college. They wouldn't even be in the same place by then because of school and careers. But still nothing. The last email I sent asked to meet with him for closure.

But then, I get a call from him. He goes on to say, after not talking to me for *six months*, how the whole thing was my fault. He says that I was was selfish, so he *had* to stop talking to me. He goes on to say he doesn't want to date me again, after ignoring and hurting me for so long.

I'm so hurt and angry. Physical distance forced us to break up, but we promised each other that we would be lovers forever, even if we dated or loved other people. We were so good together, and he's throwing it away. Reddit, what do you do when people are unfair like this?",AskReddit

Please help an undergraduate student with some Psychological study ideas,"I am currently attending a university in California, and I have 10 Ph.D. applications out.  I am a Psychology major and my field of interest is interpersonal relationships, and more narrowly, infidelity.

I do not graduate until June, so I have time to run a quick study, and would like to do some preliminary quick and dirty pilot research.

I am interested to find out that if you have cheated on your significant other, what were your tactics you used in order to conceal this infidelity? In a sense, I am trying to find out how creative one person can be in order to continue cheating on a partner

My assumptions are:

1. respondents have cheated on their current or former partner
2. have used certain tactics to avoid disclosure of infidelity
3. have come up with original tactics to do it

In order to give you an idea what I am looking for, I will give you two of mine:  I bought the 3rd person a bottle of Calvin Klein one as a gift and I bought myself the same.  That way, after I saw them, I came home and only smelled like me.  The other one was using a shared email account in which I would write a message to them and leave it in the drafts folder.  Then the other person would log in, read the message, delete it and write a reply without sending it, just leaving it in the drafts folder.

Just like everything, if you do not want to answer, that's cool, I gave you my examples to let you know that I will not judge you at all, I am just interested to see if us tech savvy people are more creative than our mainstream counterparts

Finally, yes I know that this is a very specific subset of the population and you guys are in no way a representative sample.  I am doing this to see if there is more to this ""cheater's creativity"" than I believe.

I have some concerns about the future stability of the United States. I understand that those concerns may be ill founded. However, I would like to add an emergency supply of antibiotics to my emergency kit. I've done quite a bit of research and I know the following:

- Antibiotics ""expire"".
- Overuse breeds resistant bacteria.
- Some antibiotics can be dangerous if used improperly.
- Antibiotics have specific uses, not all of them work for any ailment.
- Some places are unsafe to order from.

You may notice that traffic lights sometimes lag slightly, just when you think you can make it, it goes to yellow and then red (for those in the U.S., straight to red for those of you in the UK and elsewhere). You might think the developers of the microcode for the traffic signals programmed in delays based on traffic patterns, but actually nodes of this human behavior analysis AI have infiltrated this and other computerized devices, using their superfluous processing cycles to do their bidding.

Data are transmitted from these nodes to a central repository for processing. The AI is steadily formulating sufficient behavioral data to model a chameleon, able to impersonate any human of any combination of archetypes. The asshole, the Asperger's, the savior, the borderline personality, any or all of these are mere personality spectra the AI can use to construct realistic facsimiles of humanity. 

2012 is laughed off as mere paranoia, but I suspect that this AI has a countdown whose estimated time of integration coincides precisely with day 1 of 2012, where its campaign of domination would begin and our domination of this planet ends.

"AskReddit:  How do you define ""Success?""","This was originally posted in reply to this comment 


In a nutshell: **success = opportunity x skill x effort.**  (Skill is defined here as either an innate ability (talent) or learned ability (education or experience).  Effort here is strictly effort that advances one's goal, not just work for work's sake.)

I'm a successful IT dude.  I put a lot of *effort* into what I do day-to-day and into making sure my *skills* stay sharp.  That said, I would not be where I am today without knowing the people who helped get me the interviews and without being close enough to get to them.  I don't want to go off on the tangent of how important or unimportant networking is, I only mention it to illustrate that my network is what afforded me part of the *opportunity* to be where I am.

For edge case illustrations:  

* I could choose to become an olympic athlete and put every waking moment into every day training for it.  I would never be successful at it because my genetic makeup precludes it. (I'm not physically capable of reaching the required level of skill.)  

* A kid born in India as an untouchable, no matter how smart he or she is, and no matter how hard he or she tries, has an exceedingly small chance at succeeding at becoming a world-famous heart surgeon. (Almost no practical opportunity)  

* A person who is comfortable working as a gas station attendant is probably never going to own a million dollar house.  (No effort)

From an individual's own standpoint, I believe that effort is the most important factor in the equation, primarily because that is the one factor that person has the most direct control over.  With enough effort, and if the other two factors are even just the slightest bit above 0, one can succeed.  For me and I imagine much of Reddit as well, most of my childhood and schooling came very easily.  Skills were a given to me, and so I spent a very long time assuming everyone else was just too lazy to succeed.   For children growing up affluent, I can see it being very easy to take one's opportunities for granted as well.  

In essence, *skills and opportunity are invisible* to this worldview, so effort is the only factor in their minds.  It is all these factors (opportunity, skill, and effort) combined that makes us who we are.  Focusing entirely on one's own effort severely undervalues the vast breadth of human experience that has brought each person to be the person they are today.",AskReddit

PayPal alternative that provides a debit card?,"I run a small business that (among other things) sells products on my website. I currently use PayPal to handle the transactions - yes, I've heard the horror stories, and I have an Amazon account as a backup in case PP does lock my account. 

However, I prefer to use PayPal for online transactions for one reason - they provide *immediate* access to cash via the PayPal/MasterCard debit card. Someone can buy something from me at 11:00am and I can withdraw that money at 11:01am. This makes it easy for me to be able to use the transaction money to buy more inventory and supplies for my business, and it's also been a nice safety net that I've had to use a few times when my cash flow was low. Most every other solution I've seen (including Amazon and Google Checkout) hold on to the transaction money for some period and then you have to do a bank transfer  to get the money, which may take another few days.

The other aspect I like about PayPal is the relative simplicity - I'm not a programmer, I have no desire to be a programmer and I'd rather not spend the money to hire a program to integrate a CC processor with my site. I don't need a sophisticated solution, just a drop-down list to select the product, calculate postage and process the credit card. PayPal's button builder also does this well enough.

Under what circumstance(s) could somebody ask you to erase your existing photos in your camera?,"Today, a movie was being filmed outside where I work, and when the star of the film came out, my mom took a picture of him with her camera.

Here's the story, there's a couple who live in the apartment above my boyfriend and I. They fight almost daily, I've never heard people fight like they do. They throw things, we can hear things breaking, stomping up and down the halls and the most part of their screaming conversations. Tonight they got into a pretty huge fight and I heard the girl eventually yell ""Don't you dare fucking hit me again!"" then she screamed and ran down the hall into what would be their master bedroom. The guy yelled ""FUCK YOU"" and stomped after her. It freaked me out, I figured he was beating her so I called 911. Two cops came and they talked to the people upstairs for about 15 minutes and left. The boyfriend comes downstairs and apologizes to me, almost in tears, for all the noise and said it will never happen again and all that jazz. So tell me Reddit, did I do the right thing? I feel terrible for some reason, since the girl was probably not hurt, I'm guessing, and the boyfriend was so nice to me.

Does anyone know a cheaper way to change the date on some tickets with Orbitz? I'm going to Free Culture X with four friends and we made a huge mistake...,"So, dear Reddit. Please, someone here has to know of a way they can help us.


We're the Puerto Rican chapter of Free Culture (FC@UPRM/Puerto Rico), and five of us were going to leave Puerto Rico on the 12'th, and return to Puerto Rico on the 15'th. This was so we could participate in all the conferences and activities in Washington D.C., Free Culture X.


Our president made a small mistake and booked the flight for the 13'th instead of the 12'th, we called them up today (only 4 days after we booked the flight), and they want $180 (per person) to change the day to the 12'th. This ends up coming up at $900.


We already asked a company to pay for our tickets, and we made a promise with them to give some conferences on what we learned during FCX. 


Free Culture is going to send up $850 for all the other expenses, so we were thinking of taking those $850, adding $50 and changing the tickets. But before we do this, I thought I'd ask if anyone knows of a cheaper way to get it done. We're all college students. And there are other costs to consider: Food, hotel, taxi/train/subway, etc.


If anyone knows of a way we can get a better price, please post it here. All help is appreciated. We don't want to ask for money, there are places that are much more in need (Haiti, for example), but we want to try and get the price change at least a bit lower, in order to be able to handle the expenses a bit better.

I've been researching this for quite some time, and I've come to a very close conclusion believing I have Asperger's Syndrome.  I'm 19 years old.

Anyways.  I never knew how to explain it, and still don't.  I approached them with a book on the subject written by a non-aspergers writer, and asked them to at least read the beginning.

I could use some words of inspiration or some kind of encouragement if possible.

I found this secret code while geocaching. What could it mean?,"I was geochaching, which is basically a worldwide GPS based
 scavenger hunt. If you don't- you should. Anyway, the cache we were looking for was a tupperware container. While looking for it, I happened to find what appeared to be another cache stuck underneath a bridge. it was in a magnetic container about the size of my pinky nail. However, I opened it to realize that it wasn't a cache at all. Instead, it contained what appeared to be a coded message. It wasn't listed as a geocache on the website, and it didn't contain the typical list of names of people who had found it. instead, it simply had this message:

6D40-6B1B-A7EE-4A9E-B0AE-5096-1725-2B42

I immediately thought to ask you guys. So how 'bout it? what could it mean?

second image should be rotated 90 degrees to the right. Left is up. 



EDIT: Here is the link to the original cache i was looking for. 





Edit: here is a map to where i found it. it was under the east st paul bridge across the street from the milwaukee public market.





Edit: I dont' think its a multicache. Several of us (thanks anthropolgy_nerd!) have been looking, and no multi-caches in the area fit this pattern.  I've done most- but not all- of the milwaukee based caches, and nothing looks connected to this. 

EDIT: GOING TO BED. thanks for all your help. Never could have imagined this much response. I'll be back on the case tomorrow when i wake up. WHEN. NOT IF. If anyone lives in the area, feel free to investigate yourself and take some pictures to share with the rest of the class. 

EDIT: I HAVE BEEN CONTACTED by groundspeak- the people in charge of geocaching.com. They are looking into the matter, and I will pass on any information (and windows xp codes) I receive to you guys. 

UPDATE: No official comment from groundspeak. But they pointed me in the right direction, and seem to agree with what others have said- mainly that no multicache can be within 528 feet of another cache, so I shouldn't have stumbled upon one while looking for another. Think of that what you will.

UPDATE:

I went back, and put in a note for them to contact us. Check out updated pics of the note and the location.

"Reddit, I fucked up bad..I need help to get my friends back.","It first started with sexual encounters (Not actual sex, BJ's and stuff) with a close friend. About a week later we kind of quickly jumped into anal.

I asked him, he said yes so we did it. Through the entire time I kept asking him if he wanted to stop, or slow down. He said no. Afterwords though I kind of like freaked horrible out for no real reason, I still don't know why I did that. I told him I was leaving, and just left. I texted another close friend, who knew of our mutual sex and said some things that made me look like the victim which I was still in a state of shock.

The friend I had sex with talked to my other close friend about it and now they're both angry at me, which they should be. I fucked up, I tried to apologize multiple times to the friend, he at least I think accepted it, but said that even though he did consent to it, he felt used and only did that with me to make me feel happy. (When in fact I only continued because he said yes, the whole experience was a bit to nerve racking for me..Not to mention we didn't use a condom because he got too frustrated trying to do me with one, I ended up doing him but he had no condoms my size.

Now he's been around, that sounds mean but it's true, he rarely used condoms too. Which made me very nervous even though we both were clean I guess that's why I was so shocked afterwords but he feels so now horribly used and I feel like theres nothing I can do to help correct that, or offer my support. I mean they both mean so much to my life, and I'm not just saying that, I mean it. They're closer than anyone in my life.

I just wish I've never started with the sexual encounters in the first place. I just hope things can go back to the way they were.

Note: I may have missed a few details, I'm a very very emotional person and writing this was horribly hard for me, I'm not completely in a straight mindset right now.

An acquaintance of my wife claims her husband used this BAX 3000 treatment and has been cured of his shellfish allergy for the past 6 months.  We don't really have any way to verify any of this, and there is conflicting data online about the treatment.  Will this help our daughter?

Link: 

My thoughts: the business sector that makes money from people having allergies (medication/shots/doctors) could be trying to keep this secret so they can keep making money ... OR, it could be total bullshit.  I am leaning towards bullshit, but on the off chance that someone on reddit has any firsthand experience, or a way for me to find out more from a reputable source, I wanted to ask.

"Reddit, what are some techno/electronic songs that I can use to introduce my girlfriend to the genre?","My girlfriend has never really been a fan of any techno/electronic music. She doesn't seem to explicitly hate it, but at the same time, she has never expressed an interest in listening to it. (At the same time, she does seem to appreciate the kind of Lady GaGa genre, that is, dance pop). 

I, on the other hand, am essentially a techno freak. I go to raves, listen to techno all the time, and dance around my room like a crazed man when my favorite tunes come on. 

Basically, I want to introduce my girlfriend to this genre. I've inferred that her biggest gripes with it are that the genre is shallow, repetitive, and annoying. While this may be true to a degree, I really feel that she isn't giving some of the genre's more talented artists a chance. 

So my question to you all is this: What are some songs, artists, or albums that I can use to kind of ease her into the genre? Any suggestions are welcome. 

(Also, let's please not turn this into a discussion on whether techno is actually music, bla bla, stuff like that. Save that for another post, thanks).",AskReddit

Reddit:  Will you help me plan a short film?,"I have been wanting to try my hand at a short video journal documenting a trip.  I've been planning a trip from the Bay Area of San Francisco to Portland, OR, and I thought this would be a good time to give it a shot.  However, after thinking about it a little bit, I decided it would be much more entertaining to try and actually produce a short film from the trip.  Basically writing and planning a movie which would utilize the setting and situations we will be in.

Locations: Lots of Car (driving), Anything on the side of road, Eugene, Or, Portland, Or
Since it is a roadtrip there will be a lot of driving and beautiful scenery.  I drive a pickup, and we are planning on sleeping in the back of the truck most likely in Eugene, OR.  We will probably spend a few hours in Eugene, and then continue onto Portland.  While in Portland we will be staying in an apartment, and most likely visiting some bars.  We will be there for about two days.

Characters: Driving to Portland - 3 mid-twenty y/o males.  2 caucasian , one African American.
In Portland - One mid-twenty white male, plus unknown friends.  If the story requires a female in Portland, it can probably be arranged.

Today he told me that he is preparing to ""leave,"" which means he is going back to China and that he is giving up on chemo and preparing to die.

I visited him this weekend and I think I saw him at his worst.  As my roommate in college, I knew him as a very active PhD candidate.  Not only was he very involved in his research (herpes virus - layman's understanding), but also played soccer, tennis, and exercised everyday.

He was misdiagnosed at a very large and well known cancer center, and one year later the cancer had metastasized throughout his body, especially his lungs.  He has since gone through many surgeries and chemo treatments.  Now the pain has really weakened him.  Initially he used to refuse as much pain medication as possible.  He then let Percocet in and now has settled into Oxycodone.  

I'm hoping that there may be some responses here for any unconventional (non FDA approved) treatments.  My friend and I are grateful for any suggestions that you may have.

He is 29 yrs old and needs to regain some hope for a future.  I would really like for him to be around for a long time as my best friend.

I know things can get complex and the wording can get difficult but laws governing individuals actions, things that will get you put in jail, fined, sent to prison or cost them in any way, should at least be provided to the citizens.

Can rape ever be morally justified or is there no scenario for which you would condone it?,"So here's the scenario: The human population has been reduced to a bare minimum and currently the final remnants of humanity is living on an island. The humans are separated into two tribes; an atheist tribe and a religious tribe. The problem is that almost all the women are in the religious tribe and they are indoctrinated and have been conditioned to live as slaves and as such have started to want to live this way. If something were to happen, say a powerful storm or extended periods of starvation due to climate changes the religious group would not have the mental capacity to deal with it and would die out. So knowing this, could it not be morally justifiable for the atheist tribe to raid the religious tribe and steal their women to save humanity? Of course these women, being thoroughly brainwashed would have to be raped to be used for breeding purposes. Is it really so bad considering the circumstances?

"Hey Reddit, describe a time which forced you to make a very tough/murky ethical decision?","To be clear for those who might not be, ethics is essentially a study of competing notions of what is right. It is different from a study of morals because morals tend to be more cut/dry. For example, most people would agree that it would be moral to donate to charities or to help the homeless when you are able.

To slightly twist that situation into an ethical dilemma would be something like: Do you give money to that homeless fellow? Or do you buy him a sandwhich and a cup of coffee? Or do you donate to a charity which helps the homeless? All of these are morally sound choices but each present a question of ethics because any of them could be right.

"Should Congress be required to read all 
legislation prior to voting on it?","Regardless of political affiliation, isn't it important that our representatives read the legislation that they are enacting prior to voting it into law?  I mean there could be some serious caveats within the law that no one knows except the drafters, because some legislation is so lengthy that no one wants to spend the time to read it.  

I know in the private sector I'd never sign a contract without reading it in full.  I sort of equate legislation with a contract, as they are binding documents into law and many congressmen (and women) don't bother to even read what they are agreeing to or disagreeing with.  

I find it abhorrent that congress would vote things into law without reading it.  This is sheer laziness in my opinion. 

As a side note, if reading all legislation prior to voting on it was a requirement, it might also help shorten legislation with a hope that everyone would read it.  This would help the common man understand legislation a little better as well.  

Thoughts?

EDIT:  The vast majority believe according to the input would indicate that they want their congressmen/women to read proposed legislation or that they would like it if it were feasible.  My thought is that it is feasible, but it would require condensation of the law and an understanding that this is a requirement of a senator or representative going into office.

"Hey reddit, the girl I was seeing ended it through an email...confusion ensues.","Hi everyone,

I've been lurking around reddit for a while and have gained some good, indirect advice in the past so hopefully you can help me out with this one.

I was seeing a girl for over a month and everything was going fine. In fact things were going great. We got on really well, she met my friends and she stayed at mine for days at a time. She had suggested meeting her parents and was even keen about going on holiday together in summer. Suffice it to say things were moving fast, but in a good way. As well as this, she got a contraceptive last week as things were getting quite serious and we were both clean.

Then last weekend the shit hits the fan. She went away for the weekend to see her friends and would occasionally text me to ask about my weekend and tell me about hers. No problem yet.

She got back at the end of the weekend, but something about her latest messages didn't seem like her. She seemed pessimistic about coming back. Then when I spoke to her over the phone at the start of this week to see if she wanted to meet up, I could tell she didn't sound like her normal self. She sounded deflated and unenthusiastic. I thought maybe she just had a bad day at work, but the next day she told me it wasn't working out between us...through a fucking email. She said something was not right between us but she couldn't work it out. I asked her to elaborate and enlighten me, but she didn't narrow it down any more than that. I asked her if something happened on the weekend while she was away, but she denied it.

I didn't get any fucking reason why she wanted to end it. Nothing at all apart from that she had this bad feeling. It was like going from one end of the spectrum to the other and she was like a totally different person towards me.

I was initially shocked and pissed of that after everything going so well she would end it through an email of all things. I would have settled for a phone call at least. In the end I thought what the fuck is the use of trying to persuade her to change her mind. I don't deserve this shit. My theories are;

She is lying to me and something did happen on the weekend.

She is having problems with her ex as this has happened before.

She is a schizophrenic.

I have told her she can be honest with me, but that has apparently fallen on deaf ears as I think she is holding something from me and doesn't want to meet in person.

Anyway reddit, I would love to know your thoughts. Has anyone else had something like this happen to them? Why would she end it through an email? Why would she get contraception? It seems like a load of commitment for nothing. If so did you get to the bottom of it?

I'm confused.

Currently I am centrally located, and it is very easy to get everywhere on the weekends. Restaurants, bars, etc are never far. All of my friends live in Houston as well.

My landlord is selling my apartment so I will be moving in May. The question is whether or not I should move closer to work, or find another place in Houston.

There is an apartment complex that I could walk to the office from, walk to the grocery store, etc. Everything is very close proximity, within one square mile. It is a nice, wooded area with plenty of bike trails etc.

I'd like to start an internet radio station.,"Hello, AskReddit.

I've always wanted to start an internet radio station so I could do live broadcasts of my music (here's.

I've been successfully broadcasting tests to a few friends from my desktop but if I'm going to do this seriously I'm going to need a paid provider to rebroadcast the station, and to provide backup when I'm down, my connection is down, or I simply want to use this machine for other things.

All or nearly all the tracks will be my copyright, or the copyrights of my friends - I will handle all royalty arrangements.

So here's the minimum feature I need - the ability to switch automatically between a set of music stored on the server and a relay for a live broadcast.

I need to be able to turn on a broadcast easily when I please, and turn it off again - and if my home connectivity goes down, I'd like the server to detect it's not getting a signal and go back to a stored playlist.

More, I'd love to be able to script the server, or send it commands from here through CGI.  I have tons of great ideas and would be willing to code to get them going, and to pay for hosting and bandwidth costs of course.   But I'd take anything good...

"Has anyone else been a temp for over a year? and if so, how did you finally move out of it?","So I graduated last year with my bachelor's in Business Admin specializing in Accounting and Finance. I did some travelling around Europe and whatnot for fun and came back to Canada with hopes of starting a career somewhere. I applied at many places, and the few that gave me an interview basically tried to spoon feed me a cookie cutter answer of ""no experience, no thanks"". My experience is in retail and resturaunts because I couldn't be a full time student and a full time office worker. 

I didn't let this get me down. I found some staffing agencies and they started giving me contract work in accounting/finance departments which looks good on my resume as opposed to cooking and stocking shelves. But now I've come to a point where I've done nothing but temping in similar companies for over the last year. Each position is kind of accounting related but mundane and boring. I've done great at all my positions and received contract extentions and professional references almost every time. The pay is OK but I really want the stability of a full time position that actually challenges me. Typically, many temps move onto full time positions with the companies they are interning at. However, with the recession everyone has been freezing hiring, slowing down drastically, or asking a huge amount of education and experience for even low level jobs.

So my questions are these: Do you have any tips for someone in my shoes? What places do you primarily browse (Workopolis, monster, etc) for positions? How do other accounting/finance/HR/operations grads go about ""getting the ball rolling"" towards a career in a related field? Go with a larger firm or a smaller one? I'm thinking basic entry level jobs in AP, Treasury (I realize that's a bit higher) or perhaps JV accounting (It's an oil town). No AR, I don't want to yell in the phone all day. There are also similar positions I’d consider, but AP, JV and Treasury are my top interests.

Just looking for general advice and tips essentially, mostly related to accounting/finance, but if you have any other tips or suggestions that don't pertain to those fields feel free to share, they might help someone else out!

Additonally, I know with today's economy I should be happy to have a job (kinda), and for that I am grateful. But I still need a stable position. I don't want to come accross as someone who makes more than he needs but is whining for more. I also know most redditors are IT guys and developers so please don’t laugh at my interest in accounting positions :P Also, I know many will suggest I do more school. The problem is I live with 2 roomates and really can’t find quiet time to study. Again, I’m hoping to land an entry level job and move out to my own little place. With that done, I will be continuing my educations by going for JV certification and then CMA.

Car got repossessed. what can I do?,"Hey Reddit,

Hope someone out there can help. I'm from California, and just today my girlfriend found out that her car got repossessed. So what happened? In short, about 4 months ago, her brother took the car to the shop. 2 months ago, her brother went to the DMV to pay all his unpaid tickets in order to get the boot removed. 1 month a towing company took his car. 1 week ago, the auto shop called her brother to tell him that they cannot find his car. 

Today, we found out their creditor (a Credit Union) had possession of her car and decided to claim under repossession due to unpaid tickets. Now my girlfriend was never late for any of the payments because she had setup an automatic payment plan with the creditor. Tomorrow my girlfriend has to go to some car auction to pick up her car. 

Can a creditor repossess a car due to unpaid tickets? She was never late with her car payments. What can we do to get this repossession off of her credit report? What are her options? Also, her brother and her live separately, hence this is why she didn't know the status of her car.",AskReddit

Really need advice: The man I've loved for 4 years refuses to talk to me,"We dated for 3 years in a long distance relationship. The distance was painful for both of us, and for my mental health I needed to take a break from it. My ex takes the breakup really hard. I was stuck because he needed my help, but it was too painful for me to do so while also maintaining the distance I needed. I start a new relationship, but we remain good friends, email/call regularly. We end up getting together a few times. We still loved each other and hoped it could work out in the future. He later starts a new relationship, too.

But then, my new boyfriend says he could be interested in this other girl if he got to know her better. This bothers me, and things had been going downhill over the past few months (mismatched personalities), and we later break up. I was lonely, going through a hard time. I call my ex for guidance. I start to realize how good he was to me and thinking he was probably the best for me, and I miss him terribly. I call him more. He's friendly, but not as affectionate. He eventually says he doesn't want us to say ""I love you"" anymore.

I'm hurt. I feel us drifting, so I make plans to fly out and see him. I try to work plans with him to be together in the future. But he's cold about all this. Later, he says that I shouldn't call anymore because I bother his girlfriend. A few emails later, he disappears for months. I email him, call him, text him, tell him how angry/hurt I am. No response. Then his girlfriend calls me, asking for my thoughts. I explained that I was *not* a threat to her; if I was going to start a relationship with him, it would be a year or more from then, after he graduated college. They wouldn't even be in the same place by then because of school and careers. But still nothing. The last email I sent asked him to meet me for closure.

Finally, a month later, I get a call from him. He goes on to say, after not talking to me for *six months*, how the whole thing was my fault. He says that I was was selfish, so he *had* to stop talking to me. He goes on to say he doesn't want to date me again, after ignoring and hurting me for so long

I'm so hurt and angry. Physical distance forced us to break up, but we promised each other that we would be lovers forever, no matter if we dated or loved other people. We were so good together, and he's throwing it away. Reddit, how can I convince him he's making a mistake?",AskReddit

"Hi, Reddit. I need to learn how to masturbate properly.","I was a raised as a member of a pretty extreme sect of an otherwise mainstream religion. Not saying which one, it doesn't matter. (I'm male)

Somehow I managed to do well enough in school to get a scholarship to a university some distance away, and my parents let me go because i was such a good kid they thought I'd remain ""faithful"" to our (their) values.

You can pretty much imagine what happened from there when I went outside my comfort zone. So here I am, many misadventures later, barely two years out of home, and I realized I never made myself come deliberately - lots of wet dreams, but nothing consciously.  

I started exploring online pornography a month ago and found the usual batch of useful websites and found a range of things I become aroused by.

(I had tried to masturbate a much longer time ago (last year), but it always hurt quickly, so I gave it up soon, thinking it was not worth it.)

I hit upon the idea very recently of using lotion, and it worked! The first time it took me a good fourt-y minutes to finally ejaculate because I had absolutely no idea what the hell I was supposed to do, what to stimulate, etc with my hands. I found that stimulating the head directly was best.

So I started watching more online pornography, and settled upon a pretty decent position - I emulate the ""guy on top"" position I see used often in the videos, splay my legs and ankles out a bit, and keep thrusting into my lotion-covered palm. It's a decent imitation of the real thing, I suppose (?)

Anyway, the problem is that my knees and ankles start hurting very quickly. Also, it makes a bit of a mess, and cleaning it up is also a pain (I do not mind cleaning, but help here would be appreciated).

If you didn't care to read the whole thing (understandable):

1) I need help with the physical orientation of my bits and body, because right now it hurts my knees and ankles as I thrust into my hand.

2) Need help on how to avoid making such a mess every time.


Edit: Please don't be reticent in divulging details, and please don't be embarrassed! Much appreciated. I've missed out on years and years worth of experimentation opportunities and need the help to catch up.

"Reddit, a senior at my high school is facing expulsion for possession/intent to sell marijuana. What do you think the school should do about him?","He was caught coming back from Tutorial, which is like a free class period during which you aren't allowed to leave campus. Apparently he and some friends went to his house to smoke weed, and pulling into the parking lot were caught by our principal, assistant principle, and another teacher or two. Complaining that they reeked of marijuana, the adults searched the car without a warrant (someone said this is against the law) and found 0.6g of marijuana, which according to the senior in question is about as much as would fit on your thumbnail. They then confiscated his phone and suspended him for 2 days, then for another month, and now he is awaiting a hearing in which he may or may not be expelled. 

I'm no legal expert, but 0.6g of marijuana is technically well below the expellable limit. Should he be expelled for his actions, or is this just overblowing a relatively small offense?

EDIT: According to him (although it's arguable that he's making this up) the ""instant expulsion"" amount is 30.0g.
Also, here's a link to California's policies regarding expulsion: 
his argument is that while possession of drugs may be recommended for expulsion, it is only in the case where (taken from text) ""1. Other means of correction are not feasible or have repeatedly failed to bring about proper conduct.
Due to the nature of the act, the presence of the pupil causes a continuing danger to the physical safety of the pupil or others [see Section 48915 (b)]."" 
His claim is that suspension has already ""brought about proper conduct"" and as the marijuana never left his car, his presence (and the drug's presence) never caused a ""continuing danger to the physical safety of the pupil or others"".

Tl;dr
Senior is caught with 0.6g of weed, school wants him expelled but he argues that the search of his car and cell phone was unwarranted and illegal and that under the basis of California law regarding expulsion he cannot be expelled.",AskReddit

I work in a pigments plant in upstate NY and we have our own DM water plant. We use ALUM as our flocculant and a Calgon polymer as the settling agent for the DM water plant.  

Last week, we encountered some random crap floating in the clearwell (after the flocculant and the settling agent have been added). I am having trouble figuring out what this random crap is. One of the analytical lab guys here tested the crap under a microscope and found that this thing is NOT alive as it doesnt have any cells and it did not grow over a period of time. Also, he observed random strands of (may be) polymer or some other substance connected together. 

So the general theory right now is that, may be the amount of polymer added to the city water was too much and it combined with itself and produced this solid stuff. From our records though, it seems like the amount of polymer added in the past few weeks has not differed from the amount that has always been added. Therefore, we cannot be sure whether it is the polymer or not. To give you an idea about the environmental conditions, the temperature at this time of the year ranges from 10 to 40F. 
This crap has never been seen before, so my guess is that the ambient temperature might not have much to do with it as the temperature is about the same every year at this time. 

Also, we use some other agents as caustic and hcl for de-ionization processes.

The pictures are posted below. the first image gives the best representation i think.

Dear Reddit: I think I got ED. How do I tell a girl I fancy?,"So, this is obviously embarrassing. I met this girl last week in a pub, we had some drinks, we danced, I kissed her on the dance floor and eventually got to her place. Everything was going well, we were messing around and having fun, we undressed each other. And then it struck me. I almost instantaneously lost my erection. I blamed alcohol, and went to sleep.

Yesterday, she came home, and the exact same thing happened. I blamed alcohol once more. When we woke up this morning, we started fooling around once more. Same scenario. I lost my erection right before penetration, condom in hand.

I am 23, and was in a three and a half years relationship (without any erectile problems) until I broke up some months ago. This is incredibly embarrassing. I really like the girl, but now I'm ashamed to talk to her. I worry about what she thinks of me, I worry that she's just gonna move on to another dude, I worry that she might feel it's her fault. I am very low right now, I feel useless and  lost. What do I do? What do I tell her?",AskReddit

Reddit can you help me with my Comcast/Cable issue?,"I currently buy my internet and HD cable service from Comcast. I just recently bought a second TV to put in another room. I will now have to have Comcast come out to give me another cable box in order to use their services. I believe I pay 5 or 6 dollars to “rent” the box from them so that I can view the content. I don’t ever use the “on demand” feature I just watch regular shows when they come on.

So my question is this: Is there a third party device that I could just buy and use as my cable box or do those not exist? I do this with my modem already because Comcast charges you “rental fee” if you use theirs, so basically after 10 months of their service you would have effectively paid for what a privately owned modem would have cost you.

First of all - I haven't created this post in order to seek sympathy. I appreciate if someone may think that I'm not really that fat or that being fat is ok. As far as I'm concerned - I am too fat (at least for my liking). For your info: I am 5'5"" and 156 pounds.



So far I have lost 5lb in 4 weeks. I have an office job so I spend the majority of my day sitting on my butt and letting it grow. I know the simple rule: eat less - exercise more. This is what I have been doing up until now.



I generally find it hard to motivate myself. Could you please share some success stories? Do you have any tips for a beginner? I am 20 and have never been on a diet before so any advice would be greatly appreciated!

The advice was superb too, I have lots of ideas going on. I think I am going to start on a low-carb diet, and try to go to the gym at least 2 a week!

Ask Reddit -- I've got a question about constipation..,"So, seeking some advice. Had some family come down this last weekend, and they wanted to try some of the local food(I'm in Houston), so pretty much all we did the entire weekend was eat, drink beer, and sleep. They left Tuesday, and I was fine that evening, but yesterday morning I woke up with some slight abdominal discomfort. It's doesn't hurt bad enough for me to feel like I need a hospital visit, but it is fairly annoying. 

I picked up some dulcolax suppositories, and popped one in yesterday, and I definitely had a movement, but it wasn't epic or anything, and the discomfort has persisted until today. It's a little less noticable today, and I made a small movement without much discomfort, but I feel like there's a bit more to get rid of. I'm confident that I'll be fine once I can just 'reset' my bowels. 

Any recommendations for a safe laxative? I read this thread and am considering picking up some magnesium citrate. Anyone have any other suggestions/advice?

Again, I think this is due to being unreasonably rough on my body with all sorts of food(I ate a goddamned cheeseburger with macaroni and cheese and bacon on it), and I can't recall *ever* being constipated like this before, so I don't think it's to the point where I need to see a physician.

(Yes - no animal products, very low fat, etc.) I probably consume around 1200 calories a day spread into 4 smaller meals. I walk at least once every day.

But I'm still not satisfied with my body. When I weighed closer to 100lb, I was a lot happier with how it looked.

Well, I get a few of those a week lately.  I took the time to write back recently hoping that I could encourage the recruiting industry to alter their practices.  I've worked with recruiters both as an employer and as a candidate; in both cases, it's important to feel like the recruiting agency actually cares.  In reality, they do best when candidates last just long enough to earn their commissions but not so long as to actually remain employed.

When I responded, I pointed out that having over 10 year of experience in my field and having spent the past 6 years in senior roles and management; I wasn't interested in their entry-level position some 2,000 miles away from where I live.  I suggested that both employers and candidates prefer that recruiters put at least a modicum of effort in their jobs rather than relying on only the most superficial matching algorithm and then asking the candidates if they're qualified.  As a hiring manager, nothing infuriated me more than wasting my time in an interview with a candidate who's obviously unqualified.  Why am I paying recruiters, anyway?

Well, fortunately for me, the manager of the recruiter (who I CCed on my response) wrote back.  He suggested that if I'm employed, perhaps I should get back to work and let me know that he was far too busy to read my ""page-long"" email.  Obviously reading isn't something they're big on over at BlueWolf -- the mistake was clearly mine.

Maybe Reddit can help me figure my life out.,"Ok, so i guess i will start with a minor introduction.

-I'm 22.   
-I have no girlfriend (which is more of a choice than inability to get one)   
-I have a job currently cooking for Buffalo Wild Wings.  
-I recently moved back to my parents house after i couldn't pay for rent at my apartment cause I (stupidly) quit my job selling car warranties for StopRepairbills.com  
-I'm an artist &amp; musician (i paint/draw &amp; and have been in and out of bands for years) Music being my true passion, painting and drawing is more of an outlet.  
-I'm a bit of a loner, And have serious trust issues with anyone close to me.   
-I'm Diagnosed as being Manic depressive (Type 2) and have numerous Social &amp; General anxiety problems.. I am currently not taking any medications for this, Because it worries me the meds may have a blunting effect on my creativity or originality. I'm a firm believer that the extreme downs and extreme ups i experience make life a little different, and harder, But more rewarding as well.  
- I've always been a bit of a computer nerd. I know html and C++ mildly. I help my brother write articles for his website @ www.omglole.com - Before i was as ambitious as i am now i went to school for networking and dropped out after a semester because i didn't put any effort into it.. Even though i knew more already than the majority of the class.  

Obviously i cant describe myself completely over the internet, but you get the gist.  

With me moving back into my parents house they have been very supportive of helping me get back on my feet.. I want to do something with my life, obviously. I'm just having a hard time deciding what would be the best route to take.   
I'm seeing school as a possibility in the near future And have considered going to school for many things. Obviously if $$ was all that mattered to me id do something with computers.... I thrive off of creativity, &amp; To be productive i need the ability to be creative, its what drives me.  

Self employment and just continuing to regularly create music &amp; Painting is also another thought that has crossed my mind.  
  
--My question is this, fellow Redditors.--  

What advice can you give me as far as careers are concerned? I need to be able to support myself.. Thats all im really worried about, Money is not the prime objective, Living comfortably is. And thus i want a job i am not going to hate.  
Ive considered going to school for things like Psychology, Digital art, Music.

"Reddit employers, how do I sell my personal, non job specific traits without sounding like an ass?","Here's the deal.  I have about a year and a half of job experience in the last 7 years and a mediocre GPA.  My degree is in psychology, though I do have a business minor.  I do not look very good on paper, yet I know that I can be an incredibly valuable employee.  The following is an honest assessment of myself and positive abilities, which as of now, I don't know how to put in a form which doesn't sound like it should start, ""Me: The Awesome Inside"".

I love logic and reason.  I have taught myself to view a situation as unbiased as possible, to consider all variables, and to determine on what grounds and intent each avenue contains.  I enjoy this, I love the structure and find it makes life much easier, in part because it requires that you be honest with yourself.  This requires that I organize well, that I keep records well, and that I observe and listen as much as possible.  

My grades are barely enough to graduate, yet I'm very intelligent.  Cliche, I know, but I love learning and would often go to the library instead of class because (at the time) I felt being told to simply repeat information back was a waste.  I need a challenge, I need to problem solve, it keeps me going.  I continually educate myself, currently I'm teaching myself physics and math.  I progress through online lectures and homework problems to increase my understanding.  I keep detailed notebooks, if I'm going to spend the time I might as well take the most from it.  I know I can apply all of this to a job, but I don't really know how to say it.  I play guitar and piano well, I'm a pretty good artist, and I love writing.  If I have any opportunity to be creative I will take it, even if it's not asked for (assuming it doesn't affect functionality and the like).

I don't know, I guess I'm unsure as to what degree of 'bragging' is considered confident, and what sounds like ass kissing as I've never been in the position to hire others.  I have my own guesses but without personal experience I'd like some outside sources.  Really, I don't like social formalities, I think it's ridiculous that you can't just be yourself at all times.  Of course you still show respect and I get why we do it, and the function it serves, I'd just rather talk as me to the person themselves rather than 'prospective employee' to 'hr person'.  Hell, maybe I can and I just don't realize it.  Personally I'd get tired of that fake 'i love work and will give everything i can to the company' tone, but perhaps some people want that false obedience.  Ok, I'm done, thanks for taking the time to help, have a good one.",AskReddit

Hey Reddit: What are your best Customer Service Horror Stories?,"Mine is literally still going on, but it's pretty aggravating.

We were trying to get a hold of two pills to celebrate v-day with and it turns out one of the girls doing ROP at her job has a long history of doing E. She decided to ask this girl if she knew anyone who sold E.  This girl turns around and gives my girlfriend the phone number of a reliable and good hookup who turns out to be a cop. 

My girlfriend asked this cop for two hits for $20, comes to work the following week and finds out from her boss that the girl had told her parents my girlfriend pressured her into getting her E (which is not true) and now my girlfriend can face charges because this other girl is 17 years old and my girlfriend just turned 20.

I'm wondering if anyone knows what kind of consequences she could be facing?

EDIT 1 : Thanks Reddit! Thank you all for your responses.  The parents of the minor are not going to pursue any charges.  Her boss is supportive, she won't lose her job.

What should I (architecture major) minor in?,"Bear with me, this might be a long post. TL;DR: see title, or at the bottom. Also, I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask, but any questions can be asked here, right? 

Okay, so things work a little bit differently at my school, probably because I'm in the Netherlands. I'm actually not entirely sure how things work in the US, but I know our school systems are different enough for me to be pretty sure the major/minor system is different, too.

Anyway, I should probably tell you about my major first. My major is architecture and I take quite a few urban design classes, and do projects that are also related to urban design and architecture. Because architecture is such a broad thing, they have divided the major up into four 'profiles'; one is Architecture and Technology, which is basically just architecture but includes things like constructional design and a lot of detailing; one is Management and Urban Design, which is more of a management/government/real estate development type of thing; one is Technology and Management, which is all about constructions, physics, cost engineering and the like. The one I do is Urban Design and Architecture and our projects deal with entire city areas right down to individual homes. A typical project would be designing the re-development of a neighbourhood of badly-built, low-cost social housing. 

Now, next semester (which is the first semester after this year's summer break) I get to do a minor. Most people I know do a project from a different profile, along with some architecture classes that have a different focus within architecture, but choosing a minor is not limited to this. I can either choose one of these things; do a minor from another faculty at my school, which would be something like industrial design or business; or I could do a minor at any other university in the Netherlands. So basically, I can minor in anything!

Are there any redditors out there who have any advice regarding this stuff? What might employers look for? What do you wish you had done while still in college?

My interests obviously lie in architecture and design, but I was also thinking about doing a language, because I'd like to learn another language and have some sort of certification. I was thinking of doing an advanced English class, since it would be easy for me and look good on my resume, but it might be good to brush up on my French or German. I was also thinking about doing a master's degree in the US, but I don't really know what universities there might look for. And one other obvious choice to me seems that it might be a good idea to minor in business, because it just seems so handy (not necessarily fun).

If you made it this far, congratulations and thanks! Any input is appreciated!

Dear Reddit: I'm skinny. Quite underweight actually. I need your advice and success stories as well :(,"Now the obvious answer to this might be ""EAT MOAR"" but I wouldn't be having this problem if it were that easy.

Someone suggested I get checked for hyperthyroidism but a blood test I took a few years ago suggested otherwise.

For the Econ Geeks:  how does the U.S. govt. inject cash into the banking system while at the same time raising deficit spending?,"I have a very limited understanding of U.S. monetary policy, sorry if I'm missing the basics.

When the Treasury sells securities to the Fed, it is taking cash out of the banking system, and putting upward pressure on the Federal Funds Rate.  When the Treasury is buying securities back, it has the opposite effect, putting money into the banking system and putting downward pressure on the FFR.

If we have a general credit freeze like we do now, the logical thing seems to be to put downward pressure on the FFR by buying securities back and putting cash into the banks.  This is to encourage lending.

However, we also have rising unemployment and a large drop in effective demand.  Therefore, the U.S. government raises deficit spending by going into debt.  This I would think means it is selling securities to raise cash.

Aren't these two policies at odds with each other?

"Hey Reddit, I am a 19 year old virgin.  Any advice?","Hey reddit, I am a 19 year old virgin, and I am worried that I will continue to remain a virgin into my 20's and (god forbid) beyond.  As a matter of fact, I might as well add that I have never been kissed or had any kind of relationship with a woman other than the occasional friendship.  I don’t think the problem is my looks, or my personality, but it’s probably a lack of social skills coupled with a very worrying lack of ambition and drive.  You see, I am very introverted, in the sense that I tend to dislike being around other people for any significant period of time.  I've gotten a little better about this since I started college, but I’m still pretty quiet overall.  To be honest, the mere concept of entering into a relationship with someone for long enough to lose my virginity seems so incredibly overwhelming and stressful to think about that I simply don't think I would be able to do it, even if given the opportunity.  Of course, I tend to overthink a lot of things in my life (as you will probably be able to tell from this long-winded post), so it would probably help too if I could just learn to chill out.

Then there’s the issue that my behavior isn’t consistent all of the time.  For example, on some days, I can get a lot of things done, and I am able to socialize really well and everything.  But there are also days when I basically just feel like shutting myself off from the world.  What I’m getting at is that even if I did start going out with someone, I’m not sure that I would be able to handle the responsibility of being an emotionally reliable and stable person.

I was also reading the “If you had to do college all over again” thread, and noticed that the top comment was “have more sex.” Well, I really hope I don’t end up wasting my next 3 and a half to four years at college like I wasted my life in high school, because I think I would seriously regret that.  I’m not just talking about relationships either, I want to experience life to the fullest in college and I feel like I haven’t been doing that so far.  I also recognize that any problems I have certainly run deeper than simply not having a girlfriend.  I also need to pretty much change everything about my lifestyle and my outlook on life in order to become the person I want to be.

Of course, I’ve read all the nice-sounding platitudes on the internet about how I should just “be more assertive and outgoing,” and “change my outlook on life,” etc., but some of the advice is easier said than done.

I could have sworn I saw a BDSM-oriented place whilst searching on Yelp last spring, but I never got to investigate.

Any suggestions would be awesome!  Please keep in mind that I have a relatively modest budget.  Thanks!",AskReddit
I found the place I really want to work (they have not advertised any job openings) is it annoying/will it hurt my chances to walk in with a resume?,"This is THE place I want to work.  Their website says they accept resumes at any time and provide an email address to send them to.  This is a rehabilitation clinic with locations in 5 cities in my province.  The email they provided was for their main office.  There are no email addresses provided for the individual locations.  I am afraid my resume will get thrown in a pile and forgotten.

I really don't want to hurt my chances with this employer.  Should I bring a resume in and ask to speak to someone at the clinic in my city?  I would even be willing to volunteer for a bit if needed just to get in the door.  I am qualified for the position and know it would be a great fit for me.  I don't want to annoy anyone or make a bad first impression.  

Any feedback would be appreciated. Thanks :)",AskReddit

I'm mainly suggested in advice on the order I should watch them in (don't worry, you don't need to tell me the obvious things, e.g., I know that I should watch *fellowship* and *the two towers* before *return of the king*). Feel free to add any comments of any sort, or anything you'd like me to know. I am afterall doing this so I can understand many of the references and allusions everyone makes to movies all the time.

(edit2: just a clarification, as I pointed out in my comment: «I wasn't going for just American culture. I guess these movies are ones that everyone has watched, and that everyone thinks you have watched (like 'Pulp Fiction', or 'the Godfather' -- I haven't watched those). So besides that added plus, I'm watching them also for the entertainment value - and to feel 'in' on in the conversations that might allude to them.» -- and also, thank you to all of you who have so far replied with advice :))",AskReddit

"Hey Reddit, I need your advice. It's about my family and money...","Ok, I'm 26 years old. I live with my parents. They're going down the path of losing there house. A failed start up business they setup before the financial crises has since put them in a lot of debt. They've refinanced there home and all there debt together and have been somehow maintaining the minimum monthly payments. It's recently become apparent that that's not enough and are progressing down the road of losing their house.

Ok, so fast forward to now. They're asking me to buy the house. Its in inner Sydney so it hasn't been negatively affected by the housing bubble. Its worth AUD$900,000+ (that's being conservative) and it's got AUD$630,000 owing on the mortgage, so that's the price i'd be buying it at. I earn a tad over AUD$100,000 a year before taxes, and don't have any debts or cc plus about 30k in savings.

They'll be making the repayments for my loan, which they can afford (they both work) and are 51&amp;48 yrs old so they have at least 10 years b4 retirement.

Now the problem. What happens when they retire? Do I kick them out? Or worse, what happens if they lose there job? Even if one is still working and the other getting welfare, they won't be able to make the monthly payments. Or worse yet, if one passes away?? How can I kick out a widow that's my parent?

I intend on moving out in the next year, so it's not like I can make the payments as I'd have my own place and living expenses. Also, what will happen when I get married/have kids and I want my own place and will need a mortgage then.

Anyways, I'm pretty stressed out and am not thinking as clear and without emotion as what I should in this situation.

Any advice/comment/experience/opinion you guys may have would be very much appreciated.

I'm in the process of trying to lose weight. I've already motivated myself to run on my treadmill; I've gone jogging 5/7 days this week, and I'm not going to let myself take more then one day breaks. I'm slowly pushing how long I can go into a full jog before I run out of breath. 

I realized that if I'm going to have a chance at improving myself I need to completely drop pop. I'm worried about replacing it with something that would be counter productive to my goals.

How Capital One credit applies payments of its customers.  Can someone briefly explain this please?,"&gt;**How Do You Apply My Payment?**
We will apply your payment to pay off lower-rate balances before paying off higher-rate balances. As of 2/22/10, we will apply your minimum payment to pay off lower-rate balances before paying off higher-rate balances. *We will apply any portion of your payment in excess of your minimum payment to higher Annual Percentage Rate balances before lower ones.*

This is from Capital One's disclosures page.


So, let's say the minimum payment is for $15, and I send in $100. What I understand based on their language is that only 15 out of the 100 will be applied towards the portion of the bill with the lower APR?  (I transferred money from another credit card bank thinking I was consolidating my debt to a lower interest rate based on those ""checks"" that Capital One offers to transfer debt.  Is this good?

How have you been screwed over at work?,"I am asking this because not more than 24 hours ago I was informed by a friend that apparently a co-worker, who wishes he could be my boss, is trying his damnedest to get me fired. I am an IT contractor (prior service) working with the US military and this idiot is currently serving, but contractually I do not report to him or really anyone else in the shop for that matter. Also said idiot, is heavily into reading psychology, body language, and basically wants to mind fuck everyone he comes across. Another coworker and I are assuming he's pissed because I am younger, ""less educated"" in the form of IT certifications, but make a lot more than him.

Over the next few weeks I am going to play his psych game and basically do whatever I can to fuck his world over. This is mainly because I can be a very sadistic asshole and do not take kindly to someone threatening me without just cause. I am still highly pissed right now because this news also killed the buzz I was working so diligently on last night.

"Advise me Reddit, I've contracted for an American company for two months now and I think I won't be seeing any money.","I live in the EU and started working by contract with a US-based company about two months ago. In exchange for my services (developing software) I was to be paid every month a certain amount of money.

I received my first project from them in mid-December, estimated it based on the loose specs that came with it, the estimate got approved and commenced work. Gave a deadline for February 1st. Late December I received another project from them that had to be done concurrently. Started work on that one as well, but I was told to give more focus to the first one, which I did. 

January came and went and due to feature creep and the end-client requesting many features not present in the specs I missed the February 1st deadline. Late January I sent a couple of emails asking about the payment for December and received no answer. This week I received a strongly worded email from the company I was contracting for telling me I was not really working as well as they expected, based on the end-client's opinion. Last two weeks I worked 16 hours a day at least, trying to meet the deadline, but failed to do so.

Now, the end-client for the second project was ecstatic about my work (quote: ""Awesome work!"") as opposed to the other (quote: ""Nothing really works, WTF""), and I know that the software I wrote is not as bad as they try to make it look.

By the looks of it, I'm getting the impression that they are trying to screw me over the money, i.e., avoid paying me. I have a written contract with them but I have the feeling that trying to sue them is gonna cost me ten times more than the money they owe me.

Is there a way to block those who use adblock from visiting your website?,"I started up a small forum community a while back. It had a few hundred members. People were always on and the threads were flowing. Then, somebody started a forum topic asking everyone if they used AdBlock. It was clear from the replies that the majority of my users did. This explained why my adsense revenue was so low for a website that was getting more traffic than my other websites, but still making less. I was getting thousands and thousands of page loads a day, yet my impressions were as low as hell. I made about $20 throughout a 10 month period. The time came around for me to renew the hosting plan and I decided not to since the site was running at such a loss. I didn't want to make millions from these ads - instead I just wanted the site to be self-sufficient, which is the least thing I could have asked for considering the effort I put into it. After the domain went down, I got scores of angry emails off members who were actually annoyed that I had taken down their little community. I laughed. I had been asking them to remove adblock when browsing the site for months, but none of them listened. How they thought they could just use something for free and then **purposely** stop that free thing from supporting itself is beyond me. Long story short: I wasn't going to be putting effort and money into something that wasn't giving anything back. The moral of the story? The more people that use adblock, the less things people will get for free. Right now, you have a lot of 'dumb' users who don't know how to install things like Adblock. But as word about adblock spreads and other easier-to-install or installed-by-default solutions come out, expect webmasters to either charge for things that used to be free or find a way to lessen the enjoyment/functionality of their websites for those who use things like Adblock. Oh and just so you know, I don't support pop-up ads, flash ads etc. I would never and have never supported them.

This got me thinking about other things, like the advantages of sites like angieslist.com, or my fave, consumerreports.org. My brain then went on a journey of fantasy, where things like dating or public elections went through the same process, where, for instance, in dating you would have a private list of votes up and down, where you could go back and look at why and where you up- or down-voted, so that a semblance of reason or at least better recall would invade relationships, maybe permitting better choices; or an external up- and down-vote bubble, allowing registered users (snigger) to help or warn others of potentially good or bad choices.

"Reddit, this July I pay my first-ever visit to the States (I'm a 48-year-old Englishman). What should I seek out to counter my negative preconceptions of life in the US?","OK, here's the thing: I'm a middle-aged, well-educated, Englishman; reasonably well travelled (most of Europe, Middle East, Africa, Japan) and with a high regard for (much) American music, cinema and literature. I know  some Americans - but they're the ones who've travelled abroad so they may not be typical. ( I read somewhere that most Americans don't have a passport). 

Here are some common European negative generalisation about life in the US and the people that live it. 

1) America has a fundamentally racist culture. Just as the UK is defined by class, and Canada by language, so Americans define themselves first and foremost by race. Political correctness masks the reality most of the time but occasionally (OJ, Michael Jackson)  the truth is brought brutally to the fore. 

2) American is as big as it is parochial. Americans are so focussed on themselves, their families, their neighbourhood and their huge country that they have come to believe that the world is America. News outlets reinforce this by marginalising non-US stories, or twisting them with an American perspective. Out of this parochiality comes support for a fundamentally mistaken/corrupt foreign policy that alienates  the rest of the world. 

3) America deludes itself that it is the land of the rugged individualist. In reality, it has an intensely conformist and timid mainstream culture where fear of the ""other"" increasingly stifles individualism. This fear - wilfully stoked by the media and politicians - drives lunatic gun laws, an inhumanly harsh prison policy and a wasteful and doomed ""war on drugs"" that has destroyed countless lives and has cost billions to maintain. 

I'm fully aware that I have left out half the picture here. The Americans I have met are by and large friendly and welcoming. They are patriotic, generous, and share with us a common sense of humour  (even though their appreciation of irony declines the further westward one travels). They respect creativity and hard work and seek to reward both accordingly. And lots of other good things too. 


My question: what can I seek out to shatter my negative pre-conceptions and reinforce my positive ones? 


I have nearly a month in the States to do this.

EDIT:

Just logged in to see how this post was doing and am gratified and horrified in equal measure. 

At one end of the spectrum there are comments from people who appear delighted to have the excuse to be offended. Worryingly, the best example of this also is the top-rated. 

There are those who are just rude (""asshat"", ""twat"") and the extraordinarily chippy (""shitty English smug"", plus threats of violence - nice).

And there are those who turn my stereotypes upon their head, and are genuinely funny aoo. You made me laugh. Nitrogentriiodide, you are much closer to the truth than you think! 

For those who took the time to answer my, perhaps badly phrased, question in the spirit in which was asked, I thank you.

This is what I take away from this: Forget preconceptions. Come to a rich, exciting and varied country and leave my pre-formed ideas at home. Don't expect everyone to be the same, or to fulfil some stereotype gleaned from a TV show. Treat everyone as an individual and be as friendly to Americans as they are likely to be to you.

Avoid Utah and chocolate.

Visit Charlottesville.

Don't ask people to turn their music down.

Are 3D TVs a big scam perpetrated by the TV and video industry?,"From what I've read, it seems there are several methods used to produce 3D:

* Red / Blue Glasses 
* Polarized glasses
* Alternate frame sequencing
* Autostereoscopic

Red / Blue sucks, so that's understandably out of the running. However, polarized 3D has always blown me away - from my first time seeing Captain EO at Epcot Center. No special hardware needed - just a pair of plastic glasses with reversed polarized lenses in them. 

However, the TV manufacturers are now making TVs that utilize ""Alternate frame sequencing"" 3D which require special hardware to open and close a shutter on the glasses so that only one eye is looking at the TV at one time. Autosteroscopic involves a special type of lense as the screen, and is known to cause headaches and eye-strain with prolonged viewing.

So, why is the TV / Video industry only pushing the 2 methods that involve consumers purchasing expensive hardware, when polarized 3D works great? I have only ever seen red/blue and polarized 3-D. Does ""Alternate frame sequencing"" work any better?",AskReddit

I've written some specs in the past (Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Family Guy) but I wanted to try something new/challenging as this is my last writing class before I graduate. Film school is nuts, but ideally I hope to end up in a writers room instead of back home holding my life together with a delicate mixture of self-loathing and lukewarm ejaculate.

EDIT: Does this list hold any weight?",AskReddit

"Reddit, how do you measure a penis?","Do you measure a penis from tip to balls? or from base of hair (on top) to tip?   I have always thought you measured it from tip to balls but someone told me that was incorrect.

how can i track my movements through a 3rd world country?,"I am planning on going on a 'medical brigade' trip down to honduras in a little over a month from now. Is there a cheap way I can track my movements in realtime (or atleast 'hourly') on an online map so my sponcers can see where I am heading? As you can imagine I will either won't have any or will have extremely limited internet access for the duration of my trip.

ps. I don't have any experience with gps tracking or even gps units in general for that matter.. 

edit: I am hoping i can set something up for around $100 (plus or minus a little bit). I am an undergrad and will be going with a 501c3 nonprofit so money is already tight as is.",AskReddit
Self-starting Entrepreneur: How do I start doing market research on blind consumers?,"I'm considering making watches that look like classy watches, but have the added benefit of a tactile element so that blind or visually impaired wearers can feel what time it is. 

I'm trying to decide if there is enough want for watches that the blind/VI can use, that don't require you to wear a ""blind person's watch"". Watches that ""feel as good as they look.""",AskReddit
AskReddit: How have you handled the situation where your significant other finds your porn?,"My gf is using my laptop on the bus while I'm asleep and she's looking for where I keep my movies. She somehow finds the folder containing some of my porn. What's worse is she doesn't tell me right away. She lets me know a week later. All I could say was, ""Well, yeah.""",AskReddit
"My GF/BFF has Livedoid Vasculitis to a debilitating degree, no insurance and no clue what to do... pls hlp!","She was diagnosed with Livedoid Vasculitis during her senior year of HS when she was just my best friend. She is 25 now and the disease has progressed to the point that even moderate physical activity like hiking is uncomfortable and often unmanageable. Perhaps the biggest effect has been on her self-esteem, we live in Hawaii and she's absolutely mortified to go to the beach - a tragedy considering how nice the beaches are and how absolutely incredibly beautiful she is. 

We both dont have insurance but even when she did have insurance she was only prescribed naproxen, b vitamins and told to avoid alcohol (she followed 2/3 of those directions, bless her). When she does drink alcohol too frequently the discoloration often gets worse and turns into large patches of sores/lesions (only on her ankles but now spreading to her feet). She does NOT have diabetes, and most of the stuff online seems to refer to Livedoid Vasculitis as a complication of diabetes and mostly refers to treating diabetes in order to treat the L.V. I just want to know if there is anybody out there who deals with this/has dealt with this? Doctors, when she has been able to see them, have seemed relatively clueless and seem to offer nothing more than platitudes along the lines of ""well it's a very rare disease, we dont know much about it."" Now, I know that's probably because she hasn't seen a good doctor but we're simply in no position right now to pay for one.

I've been on reddit for a little over a year now and you guys are constantly re-affirming my faith in the human race and astounding me with the plethora of knowledge within this rag-tag collective - I know somebody out there can help her/me/us. My GF is more adorable than kittens, more delicious than Bacon and cool as Linux so PLEASE if you can stop pwning trolls for long enough... any advice will be greatly appreciated (but taken with a grain of salt, as this is the interwebs). This is my first post because this is the most important thing I could think to come to you guys with, make me proud yall...

Aloha!",AskReddit
