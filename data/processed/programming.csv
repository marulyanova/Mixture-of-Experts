"Programmers, do you put your comments (before|after) the related code?","Inspired by: 

In the several years I've been writing code, I have never seen someone write comments after code until that comment. The thought of doing that had never occurred to me either. 

On reading the comment's code snippet, it seemed to make more sense to me having the comment after the code. Ie, ""here's the code, now we'll explain"" instead of ""here's what's going on, now here's the code"".

Do you put your comments before or after your lines/blocks of code?",programming
Anyone want to give some good 'finding a job' tips to a soon-to-be-minted CS degree holder?,"I'm approaching the end of my junior year of college. I already have a really nice job with serious responsibilities that is completely unrelated to software engineering.

Should I try really hard to get an internship for the summer and abandon my job, or is intern experience irrelevant? Does anyone have any links to good resume writing for software engineers? Should I find an open source project and start contributing immediately? How does the job market look for those starting out? I have met a couple young software engineers and they seem to be doing OK, at least compared to a finance friend who is working at Walmart =(

I attend a very good school and will most likely end with 3.2-3.5 GPA and a second degree in Latin.",programming

[I am new to reddit, so please pardon any breach of protocol.]

We're working on a project involving channel allocation in wireless cellular networks. We're basically trying to find a newer, efficient algorithm for channel allocation. I'm trying to find a program which will help me simulate a GSM network - network towers, cells, users in a cell, users moving between cells, etc. The allocation algorithm in a cell, of course, should be programmable.

Collaboration? Visualising disease spread on social networks generated from Facebook.,"Hey reddit. I'm a mathematical epidemiologist specialising in modelling the spread of infectious diseases (flu, HIV, malaria etc.). I've had an interesting idea for a side project on how diseases spread through social networks based on data from Facebook.

I can do all the maths and visualisation stuff, but don't know how to actually get the data off the net. What I could do with is for someone with appropriate programming skills to help me write a bit of code read the URL of a facebook page and then get the URLs of all their friends and so. Ideally I'd like to this in R as that's what I do my analysis with. Given that information I could do some cool things. I could even make you pretty pictures of what your friendship network looks like.

Heres a rather old movie of the spread of a curable STD such as gonorrhea on a simulated sexual contact network. I'd like to do something similar and better on a Facebook derived network.



Would really appreciate any help or feedback.",programming
What is the best IDE for open source projects?,"I have had a rough and tumble relationship with IDE's. I started with textpad, them made my way to emacs, then used Eclipse for various java projects, and now I use XCode for everything except Java.

So then, is there an IDE as fully featured as XCode, but built for open source projects?

Just got this email from Google...Thought I'd Share,"Dear Google Apps admin,​

In order to continue to improve our products and deliver more sophisticated features and performance, we are harnessing some of the latest improvements in web browser technology.  This includes faster JavaScript processing and new standards like HTML5.  As a result, over the course of 2010, we will be phasing out support for Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 as well as other older browsers that are not supported by their own manufacturers.

We plan to begin phasing out support of these older browsers on the Google Docs suite and the Google Sites editor on March 1, 2010.  After that point, certain functionality within these applications may have higher latency and may not work correctly in these older browsers. Later in 2010, we will start to phase out support for these browsers for Google Mail and Google Calendar.

Google Apps will continue to support Internet Explorer 7.0 and above, Firefox 3.0 and above, Google Chrome 4.0 and above, and Safari 3.0 and above.

Starting this week, users on these older browsers will see a message in Google Docs and the Google Sites editor explaining this change and asking them to upgrade their browser.  We will also alert you again closer to March 1 to remind you of this change.

In 2009, the Google Apps team delivered more than 100 improvements to enhance your product experience.  We are aiming to beat that in 2010 and continue to deliver the best and most innovative collaboration products for businesses.

Thank you for your continued support!

Sincerely,

Ask Proggit: How do you get your PL/SQL in to version control?,"I work on many client's databases and do a fair bit of Oracle PL/SQL development. One issue I have is keeping PL/SQL code backed up in a consistent way.

Some of my devs will save their packages/procedures to text files and add them to version control on their own. But this gets messy, and it's very tempting to just load the procedures from their IDE and start deving from there. Before you know it your procedures on your drive are out of sync with what's in your schema.

I was hoping there would be a tool that would dump a schema's procedures/package DDL, then auto-add it to subversion. I've built something like this where twice a day I grab all the pl/sql ddl and throw it in a text file to archive. I haven't added it directly to SVN yet, but that's just a matter of a shell script. I was hoping there would be a more standard tool though, since that seems a bit hacky.

Using the database backups has it's drawbacks -- no easy way to diff/restore, etc. Plus you have to deal with the DBA's to even look at a backup, yeck.

Proggit: Do you use a different keyboard layout for programming?,"I´ve always found the German layout better for correspondence and the American one better for programming.

Does HipHop make PHP a proper language for developing applications reserved for Erlang?,"The following is from HipHop: What you need to know:

See, we all know that `*this*` should turn into `&lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;`.

Why the hatred for Visual SourceSafe?

"Wasting time on ""Hello, world""; programmers want user-friendly software too.","I've wanted to learn Clojure for some time now, and I finally got around to it today.  Here's how I wasted my last hour:

1.  Look around the internet for how to install Clojure.  Apparently there is no installer, no downloadable packages, no nothing easy.  The installation methods generally describe downloading a jar, downloading a java command line tool, writing a bash script to clean up calling Clojure.  WTF!  I want to install Clojure, not complete a twelve step program!  None of the installation methods look particularly hard, but if I have to write code to install your program, you've done something wrong.  I'm considering choosing a method of installing when it hits me: `sudo apt-get install clojure`.  Viola!  It works!  It would be nice if this was anywhere in your installation instructions...

2. So now I want to write hello-world.clj.  To Google!  ""clojure tutorial"" turns up a bunch of stuff using the REPL.  REPLs are great for trying stuff out, but they aren't great for tutorials: if I have a thorough understanding of your type system but can't write a program that outputs ""Hello, world"" to the screen, my knowledge is useless.  Back to Google!  ""hello world clojure"" turns up some nonsense about installing a whole build system to create a simple application.  No, I don't want Maven, I want to run hello-world.clj!  But this gives me the basic idea of code at least:

    (defn main [args]
        (println ""Hello, world""))

3.  Or does it?  `clojure hello-world.clj` does absolutely nothing.  No error, no nothing.  I try a few things out, including writing up the Java harness the author of that tutorial mentioned.  Nothing works.

4.  Beaten, I finally turn to Stack Overflow.  I write out a question about running Hello World in Clojure and get a hit off the duplicate detector.  The question mentions a simple program:

    (println ""Hello, world"")

5. Could it be that simple?  I edit my `hello-world.clj` and run `clojure hello-world.clj`.  It works.  FML.

Lessons:

1. Have an easy method of installation if your program is anything more than a single file.  On Linux, that means at the very least having a .deb available; ideally users should be able to run `apt-get install` to get your package.  On Windows that means having an .msi or similar.  These things aren't hard to make and should be doable for any mature product.  (I am not mentioning Mac because I haven't used Mac since 2005 and don't really know what the state of the art in Mac installers is).

2. Tell people what's available.  Even if your installer has advanced to the point that people can install it simply by willing it to be installed, nobody will do that if you don't tell them they can.

3. Don't start with the REPL.  REPL's are an excellent learning tool, but they aren't why people want to use your language (with exceptions for shell scripting languages like bash).  People want to use your language to run programs.  So at least show them how to run a simple ""Hello, world"" from a file before moving on to the REPL.

Personally, once I know enough Clojure to not make an idiot of myself, I'm going to try to fix the Clojure tutorial situation and make a decent installer for Windows (hooray open source!).  But Clojure isn't the first programming language I've run into that had these problems.  So please: if you're writing a language, make it easier to get started with!  Programmers are smart and can get around this stuff, but we appreciate when you make our lives easier.",programming

Do note that I deal with PHP and javascript 90% of the time. Understanding the code and sprinkling a few print_r/var_dump works in 99% of cases, imho.

H.264 - Why should it be free for people to capitalize on?,"I'm not quite sure I understand the hate on this issue.  A group of companies put time and money into a technology, spent years on it seamless integration and adoption into hardware, software, and web services, and now they are supposed to give it away?  

If you spent your time as a programmer or engineer building something that you wanted to make money from, would you want someone taking it for free and making money from it instead?  I know a good number don't mind, but a good number do.

This is not a broken model...It's how companies make money.  It's how tangible goods work, it's how broadcasting works, it's how services work, and it's what the economy is built on.  Your time as a programmer is valuable.  If you do something, anything in the world, and you want to put food on the table and a roof over your head, you charge for it.  

Do you think Intel chips will be free any time soon? No.  Can you make your own chips and spend years and hundreds of millions of dollars getting everyone to use them? Yes.  Does that take a tremendous amount of resources (people who want to get paid, etc.) to do it? Yes.  But do you complain about Intel (or other for profit companies) being shitty for charging you? No.

"Do you find managing DNS records confusing?  If so, why and how would you improve it?","I'm rather comfortable with the DNS protocol and DNS servers (e.g., I discovered the $1000 security hole in djbdns, so managing DNS records feels pretty intuitive to me.  However, I know a lot of smart developers that can build really impressive web apps yet still find DNS confusing.

Now DNS as a protocol isn't _that_ conceptually different from HTTP (send a request, receive a response; intermediaries can cache data), and yet while HTTP servers have evolved significantly since their introduction, DNS servers have largely remained the same.  (Admittedly, part of that's because HTTP clients are significantly more advanced nowadays, but DNS clients haven't changed much either.)

So anyway, I think it'd be awesome to build a DNS hosting service that people actually enjoy using (similar to how there were a bunch of decent image hosting services, but now reddit loves to use imgur).  I'd love to hear if people had examples of what they've found difficult and/or tedious about managing their DNS records and any ideas on how to simplify it, or if they're content with how things are.",programming

"Freelance programmers, how do you organize your time to cope with many projects at the same time, and still have a life?","I recently became a freelance programmer, and I've been quite lucky. Too lucky, maybe. My 'problem' is that I've been offered many projects, and I would really like to take them all. Not because of money, but because they are all quite interesting and may open many doors in a future. Some of them are short (spanning a few months) and some of them are long lasting projects (two or three years). None of them allows me to hire someone myself.

How does your shop manage what goes into your code base? Mandatory code-review? Feature freezes? Complete testing frameworks?,"I'm looking for ideas to solve a problem we are facing at our shop.

I work within a group of six programmers, lead by our Fearless Leader who controls what goes into our trunk.  Our Fearless Leader is both a developer and a manager, and therefore is quite busy, yet he is the gateway for all code to enter the trunk of our repository.  In order for our new code to be included, a patch is created and emailed to everyone.  Someone is assigned to be the reviewer, an email thread goes back and forth until the reviewer is happy, and then when the Fearless Leader gets around to it, he makes any modifications and finally applies it.

This bottleneck has created a many month long backlog of patches that aren't pressing enough to warrant inspection by our Fearless Leader.  Old patches suffer severe bit rot due to the trunk changing since they were created.

We are at a point where it is clear a change needs to happen, so I though I'd poll the rest of /r/programming to see how you guys address the problem.

Fundamental problems in our approach from my point of view:

* The trunk should be for development and branches should be for stable code.  Not the other way around.

* A single code-review bottleneck impedes check-in progress, but can enforce quality.  Maybe full testing coverage could replace the need for an eyeball on each line.

* code-review by email is possibly not the most efficient/educational approach.

So how do you manage what new code is introduced?  Does it work?",programming

Who else feels like concurrency issues are like being punched in the face by an invisible man?,":-)

Just debugged the hell out of one, it took me completely by surprise when I found out exactly what I was doing wrong. Wasn't expecting it at all.

Oh well, made for a fun morning!

-------------------------------

The short version: on the WPF UI thread, while having a write lock acquired on a ReaderWriterLockSlim, I was iterating over a set of data and executing an update on it. The update raised an event to some higher level UI code, which eventually called back down into the level the lock is used at - except it was trying to acquire a read lock. Problem was, I was still technically in the midst of that write lock, and I had explicitly set the lock recursion policy of the lock to disallow acquisition of locks recursively. Thus, BOOM.

As with most concurrency issues, though, it appeared to have a completely different root cause, and took awhile to sort out.

I broke my biggest rule: do **as little as possible** when you're in a lock. It looked like it was doing as little as possible from the code that used the write lock, but I failed to anticipate how it would be used in this case. Lesson re-learned, haha.",programming

Anyone know of a middleware for CouchDB or MongoDB that serves as a proxy filtering unauthorized queries/updates?,"I am asking because apparently the view system/query/etc. at least for CouchDB is very rich and functional and the documentation makes it sound as though a middle layer is not even necessary.

So there needs to be some middle layer -- but all I really need it to do is authentication and then drop requests that are attempting to access a different user's data.  Besides that it should just send the requests directly to the db.

Ask Proggit: What source code search tool do you use?,"As a general question, what tool do use for searching you code? How do you love it\what annoys the hell out of you about it?

Why I'm asking: I'm currently refactoring our companies internal development processes, which included switching the version control system to one that Sybase stopped developing in 1999 (anyone heard of ObjectCycle? No, didn't thing so...) to subversion. Currently our 'source catalog' consists of a MSSQL server with a database for each code set, and a legacy indexer which use string-position parsing to parse the syntax. The indexer drops each database every time it runs, and takes about 4 hours to go through a set of code. Any time it errors on its overnight run we are left without the ability to search through our source until we can get it running again.

Obviously it's not the best situation. I'd like to switch to a better source searcher, but I'm unclear on all the options. What do you suggest? Are there any open source solutions I should be looking at? The source is PowerBuilder code (don't laugh, we still use that) and the code consists of roughly 7 million lines. I understand that no open source indexer would have support for parsing PowerBuilder syntax, why would they; I've already written a parsing tool and am looking for an indexer that it could easily fit into (its written in Python so a python indexer would be very helpful). Like I mentioned we use Subversion. Any suggestions would be very much appreciated.",programming

Using a utility to generate Java code to make my project more concise. Good idea?,"The project I'm working on requires me to write lots of repetitive code. For example, if I want to load a image file called ""logo.png"" in my code, I would write something like this:

    Bitmap logoImage;

    ...
    // Init
    logoImage = load(""logo.png"")

    ...
    // Usage
    logoImage.draw(0, 0);

    ..
    // Cleanup
    logoImage.release();

Having to write this code to use every new image is a pain, including having to specify that logoImage should load the file ""logo.png"". 

As I'm working on a Java Android game and images are used a lot in inner loops, I really want to avoid slow things like making virtual function calls and e.g. accessing arrays/maps/object fields when I can avoid it. Copying an idea from the Android API (the generated R class), I thought I could run a utility before compiling to generate some of this repetitive code for me. For example, the actual code in the project file would be reduced to just this:

    logoImage.draw(0, 0);

Using some command-line tools (e.g. grep, sed), I can look for every instance of ""&lt;Image name&gt;Image.draw(..."" and then generate the other required code automatically i.e. code to load/release the file &lt;Image name&gt;.png and declare ""Bitmap logoImage"" somewhere. This code could either be added to a new class or I could add placeholders in my code that told the code generator where to insert the generated code.

To display a new image, all I would need to do is just copy the image file to the right directory and add one line of code. Nice and simple. This avoid approaches like creating an array of images, defining labelled int constants to references the array and having to specify which filename to load.

Is this a really bad idea? It seems a bit of a hack but I can see no easier way of doing this and it does seem to drastically clean up my code. Are there any standard tools for doing this simple kind of code generation (i.e. the tool doesn't need to understand the meaning of the code)? Does anyone else do things like this to make up for language features?",programming
Which open source database would you recommend for this particular use-case?,"The database will store somewhat large documents (avg 10-60 pages) in both pdf and processed plain-text forms and a few key pieces of data about each document such as author, date, title, etc. Dozens (100?) of such docs will be added each business day and users will run ""alerts"" against the new additions and be notified of new documents matching their queries. 

We're thinking MySQL because we're familiar with it, but recent posts and other research make me wonder if MongoDB or CouchDB or something else might be preferable.

Also, the users' alert queries have to be run against the new docs each day, so the query time cannot be really long or it will act to limit the number of users of the system which is expected to grow into the many tens of thousands.",programming

"Reddit, is there already a solution out there for this programming problem?","I'd search for a solution to this problem, but I have no idea what the search terms would be.

I have an API where users need to call a certain method on an object, and the object has multiple users. I'd like to make it easier to debug which user is responsible when some user hasn't called the method. The naive approach is to have the users pass in their name as a string to the method and have the object record which users have the called the method. Then to debug, look at the list the object recorded versus the total list of users and take the difference. This might make sense for one object, but it has O(n) memory cost where n is the number of users.

So here's my idea. Give each user a UID number. Instead of passing in a string, they pass in their UID. The object stores a fixed-size hash of the UID. The next time an object calls the method, the object stores a hash of the combination of the old hash and new UID. When it comes time to debug (which it's perfectly acceptable to be a slow process), given knowledge of all the users UIDs, we can compute which combination of hashes would lead to the current stored value, and then we now have a list of users that called the method. Or we might have a couple of candidate lists sometimes depending on the quality of the hash, but that would at least narrow things down.

The problem is I have no idea how to go about choosing a hash. Ideally hashing the same UIDs in any order would result in the same hash so as to reduce the number of combinations we have to try to figure out the real list. And ideally it would minimize the number of possible lists corresponding to any particular final hash so as to most greatly narrow the possible problematic users.",programming
Ask Proggit: Is there a name for having a class with an owned thread that all method calls run on?,"Proggit,

I've found myself doing something several times lately in the application I've been working on (it's in Java if you care), and I was wondering if it had a common name or something so that I could see if anyone has written a library to make doing it easier.

I've been working on a project where I'm multi-threadedly traversing directories looking for certain files. If I find them, I write them out a database and keep going. I had a lot of threads blocking, waiting to write to the DB, so I made a DB Helper class. It exposes methods for executing various DB updates, but the methods just add the updates to a command queue. The run method just loops, executing DB instructions from the command queue, that way all the commands are getting executed on that target thread instead of the calling threads.

So, to finally get to the point... is there a name for this?",programming
"Programmers, sit your butt down.  I need to have a talk with you.","Programmers,
I am one of you.  I live and breathe code; it's what puts food on my table.  However, in a former life I was a DBA.  During those few years, I learned a tremendous amount about relational databases.  I learned how to properly design them and why doing so is critically important.  

I am absolutely sick of seeing 90% of the programmers I encounter using SQL databases as if they were nothing more than bit buckets.  And your fancy new ORMs only compound the problem by further abstracting you away from your choices in schema design.  So, please, at a bear minimum, please spend the next 30 minutes learning these few things.  You'll become a better programmer because of it.

- Understand the ""relational"" part of relational databases. This means that various columns between tables are interlinked using foreign keys](  Doing this will help keep your data consistent by preventing the data in two tables from getting out of sync, so to speak. If you use MySQL this also means you need to stop using the default MyISAM engine and switch to [InnoDB.

- Just like your favorite programming language, your database also uses various datatypes.  The next programmer who defines a column like this ""is_active VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT 'T'"" is going to get cock punched.  For those of you who think you're too smart for this tip, let me ask you this:  Are you storing IP addresses as VARCHARs?  Why?  It's just 32-bit integer written in dotted quad notation.  You save yourself almost 4x the storage space by using an INT column. 

- Understand normalization. Nailing this down will make it easier to figure out in your head how to represent the data you intend to store.  Normalizing your data will help reduce redundancy and enhance data consistency.  However, sometimes normalizing it to the extreme will affect performance and be a bitch to write code for.

- Read up on check constraints.  You stick these simple little logic checks on your column definitions and they work wonders at preventing bad data from getting into your DB.  I know that you write your code to prevent bad data from getting in, but simple little things like this act as a last line of defense.  And when your code is rewritten, refactored, or just plain hosed up by a dumbshit coworker, that last line might be your only line.

Thank you.  That is all.",programming

"Help, proggit! A minute ago I was a Developer - now suddenly I'm a Lead Developer, doing interviews!","Long story short: I'm the more experienced of two developers in a small 5-person web design/development agency.  We're snowed under with work and are looking for another junior developer.

Despite our differing experience levels the other developer and I have worked alongside each other up to now.  However, now we're getting another ""junior"" developer on-board the directors have asked me to become the technical lead for the development team, and want me taking part in the interviewing process for the new developer (starting in two days!).

I'm an experienced developer, and obviously I'm gratified to be given the responsibility, but I'm also pretty green at the interview process (at least from *this* side of the table!).

The directors are already more than capable of assessing things like teamwork and personality, so I'm mostly looking for people who have the ""right-shaped mind"" for development - people who are creative, innovative and pedantic enough to make good developers, and flexible and knowledge-hungry enough to stay up-to-date in the fast-moving world of web design.

Everyone has horror stories of ""technical"" interviewers who mistake single-answer brain-teasers and gotcha-style questions for good interview technique, so I was wondering if proggit could suggest their *favourite* types of interview questions.

Having had my fair share of inept or ridiculous interviewers I really want to do right by the interviewees.  As I said, I'm not looking for brain-teasers or ""you either know it or you don't"" questions - I'm looking for questions and/or sample answers that give you a flavour of their approach to problem-solving; that *illustrate how a person thinks*, rather than just whether they've read all the same logic-puzzle books you have.  

Does anyone have any particularly interesting/insightful questions they've been asked in an interview?  Or favourite types of questions they like to ask when they're the interviewer?

Or - more generally - favourite approaches they take to the interview process?

I am considering writing a software application. How do you suggest I license it?,"I have an idea for an application that is firstly totally sweet and secondly completely absent in the market. It is fairly simple, and I think it won't cut into my studies too deeply to write it. However, I would like to make some pocket money on this, so I've decided to ask my fellow programmers for some idea concerning licensing. 

First, some background: 

1. I will not make this an open source product. As much as I love open source and as much as I love using it, I'm a fallible human being who needs food, shelter, and occasional alcohol, none of which are free. So please, if there are any among you who read this just to tell me to open source it, thanks but no thanks. 

2. This idea is actually pretty neat. Everyone I've mentioned it to had exactly the reaction I was hoping for: ""Why the hell didn't I think of that?"" among the programmers and ""Ooh that would be useful"" among the laity. 

3. But it's not like this is the next photoshop, so I'm thinking the price will want to be low enough to be a cross between an actual purchase and an impulse buy, but high enough for me to actually make something from it. In other words, in the single digit range. 

Now, my main concern is: piracy. There is no way to keep people from stealing software, just as there is no way to keep them from stealing music. I do not want to be a dick and impose a draconian anti-piracy system because one, it would have to be based on my own cryptosystem (and everyone knows that those are the worst kind) and two, because someone will crack it eventually, and there's no need to build a false sense of security. 

What I was thinking is to have some sort of system with which a copy of the program can identify itself as having been pirated, at which point it will notify the user. Of course, the user probably doesn't give two shits about this, and if they *really* wanted to use my software they could, so the message would just have a ""Whatever leave me alone"" button. It's like nagware, but much more stoic. 

So what do you think? Any good ideas would be welcome.",programming

"Reddit, please help me with a simple batch file question.","I am trying to run a finite element program in ""batch mode"" whereby I can list the files in a .bat file and run this file to execute the commands, (run the models), consecutively. 

However when I execute the batch file, the program executes the commands simultaneously, causing as many instances of the program to execute as I have specified commands. What I want it to do is to wait for the program to complete running before executing the next command. Here is the batch file contents:

How does one become a good team leader?,"How do you handle work on a team project? When you feel like the other members are less competent or the team lacks organization do you go ahead and take the lead and ensure everyone is contributing at least something? I'm quite interested in how teams in the real world function. Ideally a team would include members skilled in different areas but I'd imagine that more often than not some team members are less proactive and competent than others.

Personal background: I've been coding on my own for a while now, but this semester I'm taking a software engineering course involving a group project. I did my best to involve all the other team members but while they appeared competent during our meetings when it came to the actual coding the team members made a few mistakes which cost me spending time rewriting a large portion of the code to submit the project by the deadline (damn you, NetBeans; I never hated you more) as well as documenting everything as no documentation was produced in the process.

I did not want to just march in and take charge as if I only wanted things done my way as I know from personal experience how annoying a self-proclaimed team leader can be. Every decision proposed I encouraged the team to discuss and offer alternative solutions for, and on a few occasions we went ahead with the, in my opinion, less optimal solution just for the sake of me not seeming like I'm craving to be a control freak.

I still have another project to complete with the same team. What would you advice as far as techniques to encourage and ensure contributions without anybody feeling suppressed or useless?",programming

A RedditClone written entirely in T-SQL in under 50 lines.,"TLDR: Screenshot is here: 
      
Ok, so we have a RedditClone in Qbasic, A redditClone in X86 assembly, and a RedditClone in LOLCODE.... What is left to do? How about a reddit clone in pure SQL. Thats right, a redditClone that runs entirely in a database.
   
So, I got to thinking...There has to be some way to invoke a SQL DB using CGI? I realized that if I wrote a simple bridge to invoke SQLCMD (SqlServers console), I could route requests to that using CGI.
   
So, I borrowed the bridge that was used for the Qbasic Reddit and tweaked it a bit to compile under MSVC.
   
		int _tmain(int argc, _TCHAR* argv[])
		{
			std::string piper;
			FILE* data = _popen(""sqlcmd.exe -S localhost\\SQLEXPRESS -U redditsql -P [PASS] -i reddit.sql -h-1"",""r"");
			for(char c = getc(data); c != EOF; c = getc(data))
			{
				piper.push_back(c);
			}
			_pclose(data);
			std::cout &lt;&lt; piper;
			return 0;
		}

I then setup my server to route requests to this bridge via CGI. This bridge would simply intercept the request, and then run reddit.sql on the database, then return the output back to the server.
   
Source of Reddit.sql is below:

		SET NOCOUNT ON;

		-- Send the header for CGI
		PRINT 'Content-type: text/html;' + CHAR(13) + CHAR(10);

		-- Comments are hax to suppress SqlCmds STDOUT messages
		PRINT '&lt;!--';
		USE sqlReddit;
		PRINT '--&gt;';	
		
		DECLARE @QS NVARCHAR(500);
		SET @QS = N'$(QUERY_STRING)';

		IF CHARINDEX('title=',@QS) != 0 -- Submitting a new post?	
			INSERT INTO Reddits ( Title, Link, Score) VALUES (
				REPLACE(REPLACE(SUBSTRING(@QS, CHARINDEX('title=', @QS), CHARINDEX('&amp;link=', @QS) - 1), 'title=',''),'+', ' '),
				REPLACE(SUBSTRING(@QS, CHARINDEX('&amp;link=', @QS), LEN(@QS) - CHARINDEX('&amp;link=', @QS) + 1), '&amp;link=',''), 1); 
		ELSE IF CHARINDEX('up=', @QS) != 0 -- Upvoting?
			UPDATE Reddits SET SCORE = SCORE + 1 WHERE SubmissionID = REPLACE(@QS,'up=','');
		ELSE IF CHARINDEX('down=', @QS) != 0 -- Downvoting?
			UPDATE Reddits SET SCORE = SCORE - 1 WHERE SubmissionID = REPLACE(@QS,'down=','');

		-- Header
		PRINT '&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Pure SQL Reddit!&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;

"short but sweet shell aliases, and global aliases (1-3 chars)","Short and cryptic as \*nix commands can be, few consist of just one letter (I found only `/usr/bin/w`, `/usr/X11/bin/X`, and `/usr/X11/bin/x` on OS X).

If you spend any significant amount of time in your shell then these are a gold mine. You won't believe how much of a time saver they are until you sit down at a box without them and have to type out the full commands. Saves your fingers too.

I also use a few 2 and 3 letter aliases but you have to be more careful about clobbering commands. Scripts you might run could blow up when `dc` runs, say, `git diff --cached` instead of a calculator.

I forget who, but someone in a video I watched online used single char aliases for common git commands. That makes a lot of sense for me too.

    # git
    alias a='git add'
    alias c='git commit'
    alias g='git'
    alias b='git branch'
    alias co='git checkout'
    alias d='git diff'
    alias dc='git diff --cached'
    alias g='git grep'
    alias m='git merge'
    alias s='git status'

    function e() {
        ""$EDITOR"" ""$@"" &gt;/dev/null &amp;!
    }
    alias et=""$EDITOR . &gt;/dev/null &amp;!""
    alias ec=""$EDITOR ~/config/"" # portable and important dot files, symlinked from $HOME
    alias ev=""$EDITOR ~/config/vim/vimrc""
    alias ez=""$EDITOR ~/config/zsh/zshrc""

    # i added them both to see which i liked better, and now i'm stuck with all of them
    alias u='cd ..'
    alias uu='cd ../..'
    alias uuu='cd ../../..'
    alias uuuu='cd ../../../..'
    alias u2='uu'
    alias u3='uuu'
    alias u4='uuuu'

It seems like more people are getting on board with zsh these days. We can have fun with global aliases as well. The biggest downside to these is that you'll really miss them when you can't use them for whatever reason. Ever wanted to alias a command you frequently use with `sudo`? With zsh you can.

    if mac; then
        alias -g apache2ctl=/opt/local/apache2/bin/apachectl
    fi

Where `mac` is a shell function at the top of zshrc:

    function linux() { [[ `uname -s` = ""Linux""  ]] }
    function mac()   { [[ `uname -s` = ""Darwin"" ]] }

My main stash of global aliases use uppercase characters but stay short and sweet:

    alias -g C='|wc'
    alias -g CL='|wc -l'
    alias -g L='|less'
    alias -g H='|head'
    alias -g T='|tail'
    alias -g G='|grep'
    alias -g SH='&gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1'

Aliases are surprisingly most of the interesting stuff in my zshrc, and I use them constantly. The rest is pretty basic, mainly just setting options. My prompt is simple but useful (I like single line prompts). Have a look if you want.

Ask proggit: Getting *out* of the game industry?,"*throwaway account...*

I could use your helpful advice, reddit hivemind. Here's my dilemma. I've been a professional game dev at a big studio for several years now, and I think I might be burned out. I'm utterly tired of the sequelitis, sick of shitty code quality and C++'s awful build times, frustrated by management decisions I don't understand, and exhausted by enormous stagnant codebases.

The most frustrating part is that I don't even feel like a game programmer anymore. The stuff I do at work is swathed in so many layers of indirection and ""process"" and our games are so uninteresting to me that I may as well be writing insurance software. The only big difference is that if I *was* writing insurance software, I could at least write my own little games in my free time and put them online. Because of non-competes, I can't even do that. All I want to do is make games and I can't, ironically because I'm a game developer.

As far as I can tell, my options are:

1. *Leave the industry.* Get some regular business programming 9-5 job and make games in my free time. The hard part about this is that I fear my skillset applies well for games, but little else. Will I be able to find a job when I know tons of C++ and C#, but not much about SQL, ASP.NET or server-side programming?

2. *Find a better game studio.* Working on smaller games that I do enjoy would probably be the ideal situation. The challenge is that it's hard as fuck to find another game job now because the economy sucks and the industry is shrinking. I'd have to move to a city that has more game studios, and I don't think the few studios that *are* hiring are interested in relocating someone when there's probably plenty of hungry local candidates.

3. *Go solo.* I think I've got a well-rounded enough skillset that I could probably kick out a couple of iPhone games on my own and maybe get by. Unfortunately, my financial and family situation doesn't let me be that entreprenurial. I need a day job with a steady salary and health insurance.

**Any advice on what I should do?** If you got this far, *thank you* for at least reading this. It's hard to describe how frustrating and emotionally draining what I'm going through is. At least knowing that someone else is even listening helps.

I understand that saying ""wah wah, I'm in the game industry and it's lame"" really makes me sound like a whiney bitch. I do know I'm lucky to even have a job, and things could certainly be worse for me. Try to keep in mind that the game industry may not be as magical as you may think. There's a reason turnover is so high.

"Hi reddit, here is Minimal, a small C-like scripting language i'm working on now and then :-)","For the last two years or so i'm writing a small C-like scripting language which i dubbed ""Minimal"". The name reflects what the language offers: the minimum stuff i consider needed (without being practically unusable :-) for writing scripts, mostly oriented to simple games (think something like a platformer, adventure game or visual novel) although i've also used it as a configuration system for an installer and it might be usable as a CGI with some extra native functions, but i wouldn't depend on that :-P

However until recently i had it lying around in my server in several .tar.gz files (for different ""versions"") until i decided to put it in a git repository. And until today i didn't even had a site.

Any comments, suggections, etc?

Also i would like to write some better docs and a reference. Do you have any suggestions on format or style?

EDIT: it seems the site wasn't clear about what Minimal is and what not, so i added an extra paragraph in the About section:

&gt; Minimal is not a language to write full programs in. Instead it is focused on being an embeddable extension language - a language that will be embedded in programs written in other languages (such as C) which provide hools (also known as extension points) that call Minimal scripts. Examples for this are games (for defining the game logic), IRC and Instant Messaging software (for writing event handlers, like capturing URLs, writing IRC games, etc), installers (for the installation script - ie. the steps that will be performed on installation and uninstallation), macro language for editors and similar programs, smart configuration files, etc.",programming

Request for Comment: Shared Key authentication in MySQL,"I have been using Shared Key authentication for SSH for quite some time, to eliminate the need for using a username and password each time I need to log into certain servers. It makes sense, as I can retain the same password for a user account on that remote server, even if my connection is being sniffed, as that shared key is linked to each system I generate it for, and is quickly revocable on the server side.

A while back, I had a conversation with a Sun employee, who works on MySQL. I had suggested that they implement Shared Key authentication in MySQL, for many of the same reasons that it's useful in SSH. They thought it was an interesting proposition at the time.

I brought it back up today, in an IRC channel, and one individual thought it was better to implement this via tunnelling, rather than handling it directly in the database server.

[[New to C++ and seeking help/advice]]: Question about Abstract Data Types (ADT) - I can haz foods 4 meh thoughts plz?,"First, let me provide some brief background information. I just changed from Mechanical Engineering to Computer Engineering at MSU. I am currently in CSE 232 (which is essentially programming 2). From programming 1 to programming 2 we switch from Python to C++. I am currently working on the second project and I have found that my professor's style doesn't work well with my ADHD, he tends to overwhelm me with information (in an attempt to be helpful) and it starts to confuse me.

For project 1 we made a program that allowed you to enter a ""bounding box"" using the following format:

Xcoordinate Xspan Ycoordinate Yspan

The program was required to test the follow: is the bounding box valid, the area of the bounding box, and the perimeter of the bounding box. Additionally, given 2 bounding boxes it had to tell: whether or not the 1st one enclosed the 2nd, whether or not the 2nd one overlapped the 1st, and is the 2nd one (above, below, leftof or rightof) the 1st. Basically, the project was to make the functions that made these tests and that provided a driver that accepted the input and tested out functions.

Ok, so now we come to project 2. Part of the goal of this project is to get some exercise in reusing code. What they want our program to do is to accept bounding boxes that are intended to represent different buildings on campus. So there will be a name associated with a bounding box, and the program will hold all of this information about the different regions. The user should then be able to enter commands such as: whereis Xcoord Ycoord and have it return the nearest bounding box name, howtogo Xcoord Ycoord RegionName and have it return how to travel from the coordinates to the RegionName, whereisR RegionName and have it return the regions coordinates.

These operations should all be pretty simple. What I am having trouble with is deciding the best way to store a large amount of regions and their information while maintaining a significant amount of ease in accessing/manipulating said information.

Some preliminary questions that were asked of us and got me thinking (and also somewhat confused) are as follows:

5.  What kind of ADT are you thinking of to model our GIS information and to support answering queries of the above types? Answer in English. (What data model and what operations do you need?)

6.  Sketch how each of the three query types above can be answered using the ADT you chose above. Describe the algorithm in English. Describe any support algorithms that you might share across the different types of query.

If someone would be willing to offer me a bit of direction/food for thought it would be greatly appreciated!

Quick question about OOP and Ruby,"I have just started learning Ruby.  Most of the coding I have done has been in procedural type of languages.

I am writing a program that takes an old IBM Cobol data file which has been dumped to a flat ASCII binary file and converting it into a MySQL table.  I have written the first program and basically it reads in the flat file an converting each record to a hash validating the data (note code for dealing with packed decimal was interesting) and then writes it out to a MySQL file.

The code is working and in the process of writing this first program I have learned quit a bit about Ruby's general syntax regarding Hash, date time manipulation, looping constructs, arrays and symbols.  As of right now the code it self does not really take advantage of OOP and I am now in the process of refactoring the code to be more object oriented so the coding of the remaining file conversions can reuse the code from this program.

My question: Is this normally how someone who has been raised in programming OOP would process this type of task or would they write the code in OOP fashion to begin with.

1. Design code procedurally -- Refactor -- OOP code
              or
2. Design code OOP

How to detect and cleanup (or ideally prevent) orphaned lock files,"I am writing an automated grader program for Linux.  It stores the grades in a file.  The idea is that students can log in to their account, run the grader, get their results, and record their grades, all without teacher intervention.

But, what if the program aborts improperly, without deleting the lock file?  Is there some way to avoid that, or do I have to just check for it, like with a cron job that checks if the lock file is older than a minute or so?

Weirdest C bug I've ever seen. Can anyone explain it for me?,"So I'm writing a quicksort in C for an assignment in my algorithms class. We're comparing different sorting algorithms, but my professor feels that rather than comparing runtime, which can vary across different conditions, we should be comparing array accesses.

So, while I've written my quicksort (with a fallback to insertionsort when the list fragment is smaller than a threshold) to return an integer representing the number of array accesses. However, when sorting a 500-element list overflowed an unsigned int, I knew I had a bug. The bug causing the overflow turned out to be something different (a += instead of an =, causing my count to be _really_ off), but while fixing that, I came across a different bug.

my insertionsort method had the signature:
unsigned int insertionsort(int * arr, int left, int right, int accessCount);

unfortunately, I forgot to include a return statement in the sort. Yet, this caused NO compile error (or warning, although I did not compile wiht -Wall). In addition, I was not ignoring the return value. In the calling code I was updating the access count (ie accCount = insertionsort(arr, left, right, accCount). This was getting a nonzero value that was always different, and usually a 2-digit number.

Does anyone have any idea what was going on? I have a guess, but I'm no guru. Could anyone tell me what was going on? I'd really appreciate it.

btw, for those interested, my guess is twofold. First, C will allow you to omit return statements in functions returning int. It must, since I write int main(void) or int main(char argc char * argv[]) all the time without return statements (I know, shame on me). Plus, I can only assume that the value it's ""returning"" in that case is just some random garbage left over on the stack. Does this sound about right?",programming

So I'm making an Internet Query Language (IQL)...,"**WHAT?** - I always thought programming should be as easy and intuitive as possible, while still being powerful. Query languages like SQL are a great way of doing that, but are a bit limited in that they can only operate on special databases. I wanted to tap into the biggest information source there is, the mother of all databases - the Internet.

**WHY?** - The internet mostly uses HTML for structure, which is great because it offers so much possibility to identify the data you need inside a page. As a programmer I've always found myself looking up info on it in different ways like a good-ol' browser, but often I needed to build some script to extract information into a database because the particular challenge was too daunting to do manually. Or simply because the information was there but not sorted in some useful way, or I wanted it grouped or presented by some other criteria. Dozens of scripts later I realized there should be easier, friendlier way to do this.

**HOW?** - Unlike a standard database, the internet is structured *hierarchically*, not in tables, but it turns out that's even better for working with data - sorting, grouping, selecting, joining can all be done more efficiently in a hierarchical model. And you can even simulate tables in it (&lt;table&gt; anyone?).

**SO?** - I've built a very flexible query language parser, which means I can use any syntax my imagination can conceive and have it parsable within minutes, but just because I can doesn't mean I know best how to, which is why I'm posting here. I would like to present the syntax I've devised so far as simply as I can, and hope I'll get ideas and constructive criticism on it.

**READY? AIM. FIRE!** - Here's a couple of examples of what some basic queries look like:

    GET ' SELECT a@href  
*gets all the links from a google search*

    GET '  
    SELECT #sortable_table_id_2 tr[td:first(:contains(""winrar"") || :contains(/^power\s*archiver$/i))]  
*gets the two rows from wikipedia comparing Winrar with Power Archiver*

    GET '  
    SELECT #sortable_table_id_2  
    ORDER tr BY td:contains(""YES""):count DESC  
*select the table of features sorted by most features*

    GET @url SELECT * LEFT JOIN (  
        SELECT li.critic_score AS critic_score, li.community_score AS community_score  
        FROM (  
            SELECT rowid, row&gt;th&gt;a@href ABSOLUTE_URL @url AS address  
        )  
    ) USING(rowid);  
*a somewhat more complex example*

These show very basic syntax like GET (there's also POST ... WITH BODY ..., HEAD, READ for local files, etc.), SELECT to extract nodes and their children (SELECT TAG does the same but only selects the tag not it's children, and recurses the search inside found nodes), ORDER *selector* BY *selector* [, *selector*], and selector syntax which is almost identical to CSS selectors (similar to jQuery's).

**WE DONE YET?** - Right now I've done this in C#, but once the framework is functional it should be easy to transpose in other languages. I'm sure it will be very useful once complete, just like SQL saves everyone a ton of time. I will provide more information in the comments. I welcome any questions, ideas and suggestions.

Edit: Here's a screenshot of work in progress

Edit 2: One of the major differences between IQL and SQL would be that, while SQL uses tables, IQL uses trees (hierarchical data). Tables can be emulated with trees (think &lt;table&gt; tag), and any operation SQL can do with a table can be emulated in IQL.

Edit 3: I've been asked if I have a twitter account where I could post updates on the project's progress. The whole code is in debug mode since I'm the only one working on it, so I'd have to do some serious cleaning before any code release. But I will do so as soon as I have the time, so I've created this twitter account if anyone's interested in getting info on it's progress - ",programming

- Learn a bit more about online marketing and other non-programming parts of a web based business. (Without the place being infested by marketers).

If my projects were open-source, I'd probably post them directly to reddit to get feedback.

Ask programming: How can I find the right developer(s) for my startup?,"I plan to found a startup company, and wanted to seek advice from some programmers here about where I can find the right developer(s).


I'm in the UK and plan to build a web-based practice management solution (client management, HR management, case management, time recording, billing and later to add accounting) for professional services firms. All in the cloud, and sold on a subscription basis.


What I need is someone to build the software. I want it to be truly great. I am not aiming to just bash this out as quickly and cheaply as possible by going to odesk or elance (unless you all actually think that is a good idea?!).


My aim is to get the software built, and then prove it by selling subscriptions to a handful of companies. I will then aim for venture capital to boost this to next level. I have some money to start this thing up and pay for the initial development. I also have a few ""ins"" to the market, so I think selling a few subscriptions will be easier than if I were to go into this cold.



*What i want to know is how I should approach the development… is it best to find an affordable programmer and pay them a contract rate to build this from scratch? My concern with this is that if they are affordable, they may not have a broad (or deep) enough range of skills to do everything; even if they think they can!*


*Perhaps I should find a top-notch software architect and pay them to help design the framework for the software. They could help break it up into smaller projects, which I could get freelancers to build to his specification.  Obviously it is appealing that I can hire freelancers from abroad to build this more cheaply. However, my concern about this (especially when they are abroad) is that it is difficult to communicate effectively, which can be a problem when working to tight deadlines and trying to build a truly excellent piece of software. I also worry that doing it in pieces will lead to a fragmented application, that doesn't feel like a single fluid piece of software.*


*Should I go for someone with academic qualifications/certifications, or just with a demonstrable portfolio? Someone who works regularly or someone that is currently out of work? Do they need to have worked on this kind of thing before, or can any good developer turn his hand to something new?*



About me: Although I don't have programming/development expertise myself, I have several years of experience building custom web applications, using freelancers. I have also been CIO of a multinational professional services firm for several years. I have the business credentials; what I'm looking for is how to identify and work with the right tech people to build it. I also don't want to have to pay an arm and a leg for it early on, since I will have nothing to sell and therefore no source of revenue, until the software is complete.


By the way - I'm not one of those assholes that is just looking for programmers to work for free on the promise of some future equity. I am planning to put cash forward for this. I would not even want to offer equity unless the developer(s) had something special to add to the company.


So reddit: what should I look for (or look out for), and where should I look? Give me some inside information, from the developers perspective. Thanks!

But this guy has made successful apps before and we had discussed the market for our apps in the past and considered working on one together.

So when the SDK comes out for the iPad, we both obviously want to get on the wave of initial apps, because you are guaranteed to make at least 10k in the category our apps are in (if the iPad does well).

Then he wants to rewrite his half of the app because he doesn't like the way he did the UI (hes a UI guy, im a data guy mostly). Fine. I was a little suspicious at this point, but whatever, let him do extra work.

Now today he comes on Skype and says that he is going to take over the app. His reasons being: time zones made it hard to work together (its only a 2 hour difference), xCode SVN was not working well so we had to manually combine code several times (I mean, we could have just set up git at some point but..), and he thought he could do the whole thing on his own (well no shit, you don't have a full time job).

Help Reddit - I need your advice!,"Right, where to begin.
**I'm a 17 year old developer.**

Have been coding since I was 12 and it's my lifelong passion. Absolutely love the rush you get when you solve a problem, fix a bug, you know what I mean. I dropped out of college when I was 17 (having only completed a year - UK education system) so was relying on my freelancing experience to get me a job.

Naturally, this extremely small company (3 employees) snapped me up. I explained what I wanted and they promised various things including a 6 month pay review (payrise), a £1500 ($2300) training grant per year (for books), and MCTS certification. The only catch was that the base salary was extremely low - £12,000 ($19,000). I had no problem with this as I was new to the industry, my skills weren't amazing at this point, and I was getting training and expertise out of the job at hand.

7 months later things are different. 
Payrise they promised me? Didn't happen. Still on £12k. 
MCTS? Nope. 
Training grant? Haven't seen a penny.
Heck, they haven't even given me a contract - I could walk out of here and they couldn't do anything. In the same way, they could fire me today and I'd have to go by tomorrow.

As for me? I've changed a hell of a lot. I'm now developing with C#, .NET, using SQL, Silverlight, WPF, WCF and I'm doing a damn good job because for near enough every day of the past 7 months I've been working my ass off to get better and better at what I do. I recently visited a developer conference - and I'm now getting more involved with the community, speaking at different conferences and usergroups all over the UK. 

I no longer believe this job is for me. I recieve no respect here and am treated as the lowest-of-the-low in the company. My bosses do not understand the amount of work I'm putting in and nor do they care when I show them. This is not an ideal workplace. 

**Example: I have a cold. My boss shouted at me yesterday telling me to 'sniff quieter'. No respect whatsoever. Tiny example, but not very nice.**

Right. Few questions then.

**What do I do now? Am I right for looking for another job?**

I've hounded at these guys about my concerns but they just don't seem to give a damn. The money isn't enough for me to live on anymore, I'm getting none of what was promised - and I only took the job because it was promised!

Right now, I think I spend about 40% of my day just doing paperwork. I have a MS Project license, and I'm trying to chart my various daily tasks on it.

For example: 

* I spend about 1/2 hour every morning doing email.

* I spend about 1/2 hour updating ticket statuses.

* I spend about 1 hour in conference calls.

* I spend about 1/2 hour after lunch doing email.

* I spend about 1/2 hour before I leave updating ticket statuses.

* I spend my last 1/2 hour doing email.

* All told, that's 3.5 hours a day that I'm doing administrative work.

So, I don't get a lot of time to do my actual work, **programming**. But, if I put in an estimate that it will take me 1 day to do a task, they expect that I will get it done in that number of work days, not 8 hours of coding. So, I need a good solution to track my time, so I can then track my actual work time, and then give estimates which represent my real world time, and not ""coding time"".",programming

"Simple but useful functions that nobody else
seems to use","Everybody knows the basics - split, trim, chomp, search, beginsWith, endsWith. But there are two string functions that remarkably few people seem to be aware of, despite of how incredibly handy they are for quick&amp;dirty HTML parsing (especially if regexes make you barf).



The first: `string between(string text, string from, string to);` returns the first match in text that starts with `from` and ends with `to`; separators not included. Empty `from =&gt; `match from start; empty `to =&gt; `match to end. This one has plenty of variations - rbetween matches first until to, then searches backwards for from; ibetween does case-insensitive search, betweens returns an iterator, etc.

Usage example: `string title = between(html, ""&lt;title&gt;"", ""&lt;/title"");`

The second one is a bit more generic: `string slice(ref string text, string marker);` searches `text` for `marker`; if it is found, it cuts `text` off after the marker, and returns the text before the marker. What happens if the marker isn't found depends on your needs; it can be quite useful to set text to `length=0` and return the whole text, but for now we'll assume it returns a null string.

Say you want to parse a command line parameter of the form ""--size=640:480"". This is how you'd do it:

    foreach (arg; args) { // or equivalent construct
      if (arg.beginsWith(""--size="")) {
        slice(arg, ""="");
        width = atoi(slice(arg, "":""));

"AskProgramming: Question on single precision 
IEEE754.","How many distinct numbers between [0,1] can be represented by a  single precision (32bit) floating point number?


I've read some of the specifications and tried to make sense of it. After some thought, the answer seemed to be very simple, and I'm wondering if it is wrong.

The reasoning:

1.0 represented by the float (shown in hex):
        3f80 0000

The numbers between 0.0 and 1.0 are in the range:
        0000 0000 &lt;-&gt; 3f80 0000

In other words 0x3f800000 = 1065353216_10 possible distinct numbers between and including [0,1]. Roughly 1.054*10^9.

Now... I'm thinking that the distance between each distinct number changes depending on the exponent. That is, higher accuracy for the numbers closer to 0, and lower accuracy for those closer to 1. Is this also correct? 


Perhaps one way of determining what the accuracy for each exponent, is through incrementing the exponent from 0x0000 to 0x3f80, and taking the difference from the significand set at 0x8000 and 0x8001. Though more easily, this could probably be done by going by the formula....

so each increment would be 
     2^-23 * 2^k, where k = [-127, -126, ... , -1, 0]

simplified:

    2^(k-23)

Multithreading memory access in C: question on theory.,"Help a non-programmer out with some theory:

I'm a mechanical engineer who is learning programming on my own. I've hit an issue that I don't properly know how to explain.

I have a really large array (250 MB) that needs some simple math done to it. I have created two programs: A single threaded application, and one with two threads (using pthreads on MacOSX).

Both do the necessary work, but the single threaded is three times faster than the multi-threaded (on my Core 2 Duo system). The single threaded system iterates over every element in the array, while the multi-threaded splits the array in two and each thread gets half.

This algorithm is very much memory bound. I was hoping that each thread could operate on independent areas of memory simultaneously. From this, however, it appears that the single thread preforms all of the memory operations in sequence, while the multi-threaded applications time-slice (with poor overhead), while sharing the memory bus.

Proggit: 2 days ago I posted a story about cooking pizza in the epoxy curing oven.  Here are the details from my dad...,"Here is what I posted a couple days ago.  I sent the OP link to my dad, and here's his reply:

\[bitter\_cynical\_angry\],

Thanks for the link -- it was very interesting, and reminds me of several head-scratchers I encountered over the years.

The story you mention involved hybrid circuits. These are small circuits which consist of very small discrete components assembled on a ceramic substrate. ""Wiring"" is metal, typically gold, fired onto the ceramic. Resistors are silk-screened and also fired, then usually laser trimmed to the correct value. But other components are put down onto metal pads like surface mount circuit boards, but using conductive epoxy instead of solder. The epoxy is interesting stuff, being a slurry of little metal, commonly silver, spheres, and resin. The epoxy is one-part, and non-conductive until heat cured. When it cures, the resin shrinks and the spheres are drawn into contact with each other, making the stuff conductive. It usually works fine if everything is extremely clean, but I sure had a lot of grief using it in a somewhat non-conventional application.

Anyway, the epoxy is put down manually or by machine, the components are placed onto the epoxy drops either manually or by machine, then the circuits are put on what amounts to a cookie sheet and into an oven at around 150C for an hour or two or whatever the epoxy requires for curing.

A mechanical engineer I worked with at Tek \[Tektronics, where my dad worked for many years\] had worked at an aerospace company that made hybrid circuits for some government project, and they had to keep rigorous reliability figures on test failures. There was a slight but noticeable increase in the failure rate, and he was tasked with finding the cause before the failure rate increased to the point where the line would have to shut down. They kept detailed records of all the production, and he ran some statistics on the failed parts and discovered that the failed units were predominantly being built on Fridays. So he hung around the production area one Friday to see what might be different about the production on that day.

What he found was that on Fridays, the assembly workers would chip in for a pizza. Then they'd put the pizza into one of the ovens to keep it warm. The outgassing from the pizza contaminated the circuits enough to affect the adhesion of the epoxy and cause the increased failure rate.

Next time you're by, remind me and I'll show you a couple of the hybrid circuits I designed. And if time is heavy on your hands, I'll tell you about my epoxy troubles.

Exploiting the 64-bit architecture to do bitwise operations in parallel.,"I'm too busy/lazy to write a full article on this right now, but I still feel like sharing.

On the 64-bit architecture, you can easily double the speed of a large number of bitwise operations on 32-bit integers by packing two integers at a time into one 64-bit integer, then applying your operations. (This can by used in cryptography, graphics, video encoding, and many other fields.) This requires no special hardware, software, or instruction set extensions other than a 64-bit processor and operating system.

Speed tests: (Fully optimized for speed using -O2)

    Vanilla implementation completed: 35.5 million iterations
    in 5 seconds.

    SIMD64 implementation completed: 66.2 million iterations
    in 5 seconds.

Of course, my code:

EDIT: I am aware that I screwed up my ""rotates,"" and that they do not function properly as rotates. The example still stands.

Ask Proggit: Recommendations on a stream flow control algorithm for a TCP-like protocol,"I am presently working on an open source p2p network protocol implementation, and I'm curious about what the latest and greatest thinking is on flow control algorithms. I could just implement TCP (more or less), but I'm wondering if there's something much better out there than how TCP typically does things.

Preferred characteristics:

 * Good all-round performance comparable to TCP
 * Simplicity of implementation, as stateless as possible
 * Better performance than TCP over high-bandwidth high-latency connections (e.g. U.S. to Japan, etc.) would be desirable if possible
 * Better performance than TCP over wireless is desirable if possible
 * Simplicity is somewhat more desirable than higher performance than TCP in marginal situations (e.g. high latency or wireless like above)
 * Less ""chatty"" is better... less ACK traffic, etc.
 * Not patented, free for use

So what's out there? Anything better than the standard TCP flow control algorithms? I've been searching Google Scholar and groups and such, but I'm curious about what the folks here know about.

My encapsulation protocol has encryption and message authentication, so the flow control protocol itself need not have any intrinsic resistance to tampering or DOS attacks. The encapsulation provides that already. This might allow for something simpler than TCP... maybe?",programming

"I'm almost 22. I've finished 4 years of undergrad, now I realize I want to be a programmer. What do I do?","Long backstory, because I don't know any other way to tell it. tl;dr version is in the title:

I do well exceptionally on any standardized test thrown at me, I've always ended up at the 99% percentile. Even so, I ended up at a middling local university, as the price was right (~$6K a year), and it's a pretty solid place (University at Buffalo). I had 75 credits coming in to college thanks to taking 16 AP exams in high school, and  the plan was to graduate quickly with a physics degree and go on to law school, since hay that's where the money is.

Problem is, it turned out I really love programming, and the iPhone OS really inspires me to do work. I gradually started working on it in my spare time, and now it consumes an large portion of my spare time. Thanks to you guys and some effort on my part, I know an incredible amount about software engineering and less about computer science (I'd estimate probably a sophomore-level student). 

I'm ending up graduating with an economics degree this semester, but I have no idea what to do now. I *want* to pursue a CS degree, I was never particularly enthused by law – I did extremely well on my LSAT, but I know working at a law firm won't get me up in the morning like programming does/will. 

I've heard all sorts of conflicting advice, and no one seems to really be able to tell me what to do – the path of least resistance is to stay where I am and get a BS in computer science, but the thought of spending another two years in the absolutely soul-crushing emotional chilliness of my university and the physical chilliness of Buffalo isn't exactly appealing to me. I have the intellectual capability to be at somewhere great, but my grades aren't exactly 4.0 material; I have a 4.0 in my CS classes but that doesn't balance out the merely above average grades in the classes I hated and never went to (virtually every other subject). 

So, can you tell me what my options are given these constraints? Is my best option then to take a couple CS courses in the summer, some more in the fall, and apply somewhere for transfer explaining my odd situation? Or do I just need to hang tough and get my BS here because no one is going to transfer my 'general ed' credits, so I'll need to retake a bunch of humanities courses just to get a CS degree at another school?",programming
Ask /r/programming: Why is it not possible to use the same partition for dual-boot and a VM?,"As a primary Linux user who sometimes has to use Windows for various reasons, I am well aware of the pros and  cons of dual-booting vs. using a Virtual Machine. But here is something I have always wondered: why isn't it possible to do both with the same partition?

That probably doesn't make sense, so let me explain: When you dual-boot between two OS's, you have two separate partitions on your drive; one for each OS. When you use a VM, you have a file inside your primary OS's partition that contains within it a virtual partition that contains the virtual OS. It seems to me that it should be possible to set up a dual-boot system, and then add a VM with a virtual partition that would then go out to the disk and *mount* the physical partition for the other OS and boot it.

I think this would be the ideal solution. You would be able to choose between launching a VM into the secondary OS or booting it directly, but either way, it would be the *same filesystem*, so all of your settings and installed applications would be shared. You would only need to set it up once. Plus, if your secondary OS is one that doesn't like being run in a VM or being installed twice (like Windows), it would avoid that problem nicely.

So can someone tell me what is wrong with this idea? Is there some technical reason that it can't be implemented, or is it just that nobody has seen any reason to try?",programming
Proggit: I'm a Junior Software Engineering major and I've lost faith in my university's program.,"**The questions at hand...**

* What is a typical curriculum for an SE program?
* What knowledge/experience is expected of SE graduates?
* What can I do to improve my confidence in the field?
* What are the typical job functions of a software engineer?
* What should I absolutely know before graduation?
* How important is development (coding) experience versus synthesis/analysis (planning) knowledge? It seems that the courses focus more on the theory than the application. Is that typical?

**On a related note...**

* I've been looking for *any* type of internship relating to computers for about three years, and everything I've found falls through. I live in Ohio, go to school in Indiana. Any advice?
* I'd really like to learn Unix/Linux administration. Where is a good starting point?

I started with HTML/CSS in high school and shortly after picked up PHP, then Javascript (backwards, I know). My freshman year I learned C++ and Ada, both using basic OOP but only doing small-scale programs. Sophomore year covered Java and more OOP, though neither in depth. A project allowed us to make a choice of two languages, so I have also used Prolog and Scheme, *briefly*. This is my Junior year, and we had a larger (group) project assigned. I was responsible for the database backend and interface, which I implemented using Java and an h2 database. The member of my group responsible for the GUI basically didn't do it though, so the project didn't end so well. Next year will be my Senior year, and I'll have courses focused more on testing than development, and the final course is a Senior project and 30-minute presentation/seminar.


Most courses have repeated the same concepts of the ""Software Design Model,"" including specification, requirements analysis, coding, testing, maintaining. We've also talked about other methods like agile programming, extreme programming, and pair programming.


My chief complaints are that the professors in the department aren't convincingly knowledgeable/experienced, and that the courses don't require enough work to be comfortable in the languages.

I work for the school's web team, but that only consists of HTML/CSS/Javascript work with the occasional C# form. I'm beginning to worry that when I graduate, I'll be completely unprepared for what's expected of me when/if I get a job.


Any advice?

So a few years ago I got interested in web design and then web programming. I learned HTML for markup and CSS for presentation, then some PHP, but I never understood it too much. I later looked at Ruby and Python, but didn't get too much into it.

Rant about technical interview questions,"tl;dr Interview questions are stupid and irrelevant; discuss

I have been interviewing of late and I have a rant about the technical questions. I have been programming for a number of years and outside evidence from others leads me to believe I'm pretty good at what I do. Where I have problems is when the work drops off and tons of YAGNI requirements start popping up, engineers making up stuff to do and lack of business direction.

I don't have a mind for details so I don't write code that requires a lot of details in terms of configuration or whatnot. If you can get the code it builds with $ANT_HOME/bin/ant and the resulting .war (for example) deploys in tomcat (for example).

The interview questions about linked lists, bubble sorts, tree structures and detailed information about java.util.concurrent seem irrelevant for two reasons.

1) The number of times I've had to use any of these low-level constructs in my job(s) is close enough to be zero.

2) the speed with which I can google 'java bubble sort' and get FAR more than I would ever need about bubble sorts, obviates the need to commit these arbitrary details to memory.

Ill make this relatively short and finish with this. I have heard the argument that without the foundations of these low-level constructs you cant be a good programmer. And I argue that the reason every single job I have taken entails screwing around with TONS of cruddy legacy code is because 'bad' programmers, obsessed with low-level details are locked into one way of doing things without even understanding, at a high level, what they are doing and why. I attribute this to the idea that most of the time no one can even adequately explain the business model.

This is not entirely sour grapes. I took a job where I understood the business model and the work I am doing is debugging AS400 RPG code (I have zero experience with AS400 but its going quite well). I was given a surprisingly lucid explanation for the the cruddy legacy code I am working with and it makes it a lot easier to deal with than say ""oh our entire backend infrastructure is in PHP because the CTO was really intrigued with PHP and he wrote it in three weeks.""",programming

C-family language-embedded threading idea,"Hi fellow Reddit programmers,

I've had an idea for a while on how to create more ""natural"" threading within a language structure itself. I've found threading to be a bit of a hassle in most languages/platforms (C++ and Win32 is a cluster-fuck), while others pull it off decently well (Java/C# do it cleanly).

The basic idea is to take the existing block structure found in the C programming language family and have each block run as a thread, if defined to do so. Each thread, like a block, has local variables, as well as can access variables found in higher scopes (for shared variables). Mutexes are hidden and automatically binded on variables used by more than one thread.

There are a few things still open in the air, such as the syntax associated with manipulating threads (i.e.: stopping or joining) from the main thread, as well as how threads can spawn off child threads, but I'm just toying with it.

Some sample theoretical code:

    int main()
    {
        // Simple ""bucket"" variable that is subtracted by 1 from
        // thread_a, and when set to 0, thread_b stops
        int bucket = 5;
    
        // Start a thread, named ""thread_a"", that subtracts the
        // ""bucker"" integer by 1 each second for 5 iterations
        thread thread_a
        {
            for(int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++)
            {
                bucket++;
                Sleep(1);
            }
        }
    
        // Start a thread ""thread_b"", running in parallel to ""thread_a"", that subtracts
        // a single value from the shared variable 
        thread thread_b
        {
            // Check if bucket is set to 0, if so, exit thread
            while(bucket != 0)
                Sleep(1);
        }
    
        // Finished! All threads must complete to reach here
        return 0;
    }

It works by replacing randomly selected words on the sites you visit with translations from Google Translate.  The translation is done without regard for context so it's not going to help with your grammar and verb conjugations, but I've been using it for a week now and it seems to be a pretty good way to build vocabulary.  You can mouse over the translation to get the original word if the context isn't enough.  I'll probably add transliteration support and some basic word-joining functionality as soon as I'm convinced that the existing features are stable.

A few questions for programmers about finding a job coding.,"Hello Proggit! I am currently a Computer Science Junior and am curious about how to go about finding a job in programming in the future. I see all of these job postings requiring 2-5 years of experience for such-n-such language everywhere. Languages I know pretty well are C, C++, and Java. 
Even though I have been coding C++ for 4 years now, I don't feel it accurate to say I am fluent in it and that is the language I am most familiar with. So I have a few questions for Proggit:    
1.) How do you know that you know a language well enough to apply for jobs in that language?    
2.) If I saw a posting for 2-5 years C# experience, would it be a common thing to apply for the job and then teach myself the language in a weekend since I am already familiar with the mother languages? Does my C++ experience have relevance when applying for jobs in C#/PHP and similarly structured languages?    
3.) Extending the second question, if that is not a common or acceptable thing to do, is it a better idea to list on my resume something like 4 years C++ experience, new to C#?    
4.) One thing constantly reinforced in my classes is that if you know one language and the CompSci theory then you really know all languages. So is it normal to teach yourself a language over the weekend then go apply for a job in it? If so... where are these jobs?    
5.) Is this the type of job where networking is the only real way into it, or is it reasonable to just call the places you want to work and ask if they are hiring?

Why I am hesitant to judge another's code...,"So I am a bit lucky in that my father is a very experienced programmer who also gave me the bug.  One of the first things he said to me when I started programming for more than just fun or OSS, was that he never judged other programmers code.  He would correct it, point out flaws in it, but always with a suggestion of how to do it better.  The reason for this is that in the world that we have to live in, of deadlines, PHBs and evil marketing folks who spring new features on a development team right before a release, you never know why someone's code is the way it is.  As I have gotten more experienced, and lead teams of my own I have found this to be invaluable.  Occasionaly of course you are going to get someone who just can't code, but more often than not you just won't get anything from them, much less anything working.  Most folks are continually improving in their code quality and understanding as they progress through one project and on to the next, and trashing their code generally does more harm than good.  I used to think I would only write graceful, perfect code that was well commented, easy to read, and as modular as it should be.  Then I got one of those friday night phone calls requesting something be done by monday to close a deal.  Then another.  Then another.  Sure you can push back to a degree, and say that you can't do something right in the time span alloted, but at the end of the day your stuff has to ship.  And it has to ship before the other guy's stuff does.  You can always clean it up later (even if you never do) and more often than not, as has been said many times, by far smarter people than me, ""worse is better"".

My new job requires me to use C and I keep getting stuck. I know the C syntax, I'm not afraid (or ignorant) of pointers and I have sufficient knowledge of the hardware level. But I'm more familiar with object-oriented languages and patterns, used to having an extensive API with common data structures ...so the code I now produce is ugly, riddled with failed attempts at making interfaces to modules (accessors, not defining structs in header files), different naming patterns and several ways of error handling.

Usually you see people having trouble going from procedural to object-oriented... well, this time it's the other way around. Do you have some useful advice on how to do this (and good C style in general)?

Question for Mac/OS X programmers,"I'm not a programmer by any means. The closest I've come to it is basic HTML, CSS, Flash AS2 and a little PHP for my design clients. Keep this in mind.

What difficulties/challenges would be involved in programming a screensaver (Leopard/Snow Leopard compatible) that would pull information from multiple sources and display it graphically? What language is involved in OS X screen-savers?

The reason I ask is I'd like a ""today"" screen on my iMac, similar to what I've seen on some mobile handsets, but far prettier obviously. I'd like to be able to wake up, glance is my screen and auto-magically see the weather, time, how many e-mails and other basic info. Maybe even upcoming iCal appointments. I know that would have to pull from a variety of sources. I'm sure this is over my head but I'm not sure why Apple didn't already make it to begin with. It would be incredibly handy to have all that information at-a-glance. Now that I think about it, Apple should have this on the unlock screen on the iPhone too.

"Proggit: I have a problem with pointers in C , can you help?","I was to write a program for a stepper motor interface.

I decided to use two FSMs, one as a motor driver and one as a button controller. Based on the button input the motor was to go forward, backward or vibrate, but I am having a pointer issue.
The controller's FSM doesn't properly pass the direction variable to the motor's FSM and I'm pretty sure it's solely because I'm getting the level of indirection wrong.

**Here's the offending code:**

    void step(void)
    {

      MOTORPORT = (MOTORPORT &amp; 0xF0) + motorCS -&gt; Out; // output correct sequence to motor's port

      motorCS = motorCS -&gt; Next[controllerCS -&gt; Direction]; //motor's next sequence based on controllerCS's next 'Direction'

    //TODO: this is where the problem occurs. 'controllerCS -&gt; Direction' doesn't get fed into 'motorCS -&gt; Next[index]' as an index.

    // in fact, I don't know what it does at all. I think it just laughs at me for not getting the level of indirection right.
     }

Since *controllerCS -&gt; Direction* is a pointer to an address I think that I am accidentally passing the address to *motorCS -&gt; Next* but I am not sure.


**Here's the motorState FSM:**

    unsigned char BtnInput;   /* holds initial port input from buttons. used to index 'Next' in controllerFSM */

    /* states for the stepper movement */

    const struct motorState
    {
      unsigned char Out;      /* Output to Port H */
      const struct motorState *Next[3];
    };

    typedef const struct motorState motorStateType;
    typedef motorStateType *    motorStatePtr;
    motorStatePtr motorCS;  /* Current motorState */

    #define S5  &amp;FSM[0]
    #define S6  &amp;FSM[1]
    #define S10 &amp;FSM[2]
    #define S9  &amp;FSM[3]

    motorStateType FSM[4] = 
    {
      {0x05,{S6,S9,S5}},
      {0x06,{S10,S5,S6}},
      {0x0A,{S9,S6,S10}},
      {0x09,{S5,S10,S9}}
    };

**Here's the controllerState FSM:**

    const struct controllerState
    {
      unsigned char Direction;            // Output to Port T
      unsigned short Time;          // Time in msec to wait in this state
      const struct controllerState *Next[16];  // Next state if input=0,1,2,3
    };

    typedef const struct controllerState ctrlStateType;
    typedef ctrlStateType *    ctrlStatePtr;
    ctrlStatePtr controllerCS;  /* Current State */



    ctrlStateType controllerFSM[10] =
    {
    /*0:Rest*/  {direction,time,{nextstates}},
    /*1:Fore*/  {direction,time,{nextstates}},
    /*2:Back*/  {direction,time,{nextstates}}

     };


Please let me know if I should comment some more, I never know how much to write in my comments.

Edit: removed most of the preprocessor directives for readability.

In case you are going to say '*next[]' never gets initialised, it does.

*Next[3] actually works; if I write
    motorCS = motorCS -&gt; Next[0];

for example, the motor steps forward just fine.
The problem is when I try to retrieve the index from the controller's FSM by saying

    motorCS = motorCS -&gt; Next[controllerCS -&gt; Direction];",programming

"Tired of people comparing languages by doing Project Euler problems, suggest alternatives","I'm tired of people comparing languages by doing Project Euler problems.  I mean, it sounds like a great way to learn some of each language's strengths and weaknesses, and it's cute to post performance comparisons.  But it's obvious in these posts that the author is not really that familiar with some of the languages in question, and that these small exercises aren't helping.  The benchmarking is downright silly.

I think if you want to learn a language, try writing a nontrivial program in that language.  Write a web application in Haskell (the language is more suited for it than you'd think).  Write an adventure game in Prolog (again, the language is good at that).  Write a web scraper in Python (okay, maybe that's too easy).  Do something someone else hasn't already solved for you.  Not that you shouldn't do Euler problems, but what's the fun of never doing something nobody's done?  I would love to see more suggestions below.

Should I start my project over using a web framework?,"I created a comic book (.cbr/.cbz) reader using php, mysql and apache.  (I put the code on Sourceforge as a lark:  ).

The .cb{r,z} files are stored on the hdd and the database knows where to look for them and what files are within.

Which job to take out of college.,"Hey everyone,

I am a senior at a pretty big university and getting close to graduation, as it stands now I have two offers for full time employment. The first being at a big company doing client application development (Java, J2ee, SAP, etc) the other is working for the university (I currently work as a student developer and am being offered to stay on full time) doing .NET web development (ASP.NET, Silverlight, MVC, etc)

Here are some pros/cons for each company that I can think of:


Big company:

pros: advancement, great training programs, structured application development, adds more diverse experience to my background

cons: less pay, no continued education



college job:

pros: what I've been doing for the past year, laid back environment, higher pay, free higher education

cons: less structured, development can get messy between people (no coding standards etc), stuck at same level until i move on or retire, and about the same pay



I love my current job because it is very laid back, the people are great, and i enjoy working with .Net. At the moment I am leaning towards the big company because I want to be able to advance and become a project manager or lead developer at some point and also because I want the professional development experience of working with coding standards and all that jazz.

What I would like to know from you guys is what your experience has been like working with a large software developer and if you've enjoyed it or just simply what advice you could give and what your thoughts are on my situation.

Thanks!

[Ask] Authentication solution for REST?,"I'm building a web-based application and I want it to be mostly AJAX talking to a remote REST service. There will be a user registration/login facility and many responses from the server will, naturally, depend on the login status.

What is the simplest solution for this? Ideally, I want my REST service to be easily debuggable from a browser without any additional tools. Is it cookies? Some session tokens? If so, are they passed in the URL (porbably a bad idea) or in HTTP headers?

Any real-world examples, maybe, of how some of the popular web sites do authentication with REST?


**Update**: Thank you for your answers. So the consensus so far is:

* Basic HTTP Auth: least secure, need SSL. Pros include: you can debug stuff by providing user/password in the URL (e.g.  You can prevent the browser from displaying the ""ugly"" dialog by simply not sending 401, but instead you send some other response code to let your client know the resource requires authentication. Your AJAX client will figure what to do.

* Digest HTTP Auth: supported by major browsers, more secure, OK without SSL in principle. However, in this case 401 should be sent to let the browser know about the particular auth method in use.

* Custom auth methods are in the end just non-standard variations of the Digest HTTP Auth, except you are free to decide where and how to send auth data (headers, request/response body, URL). Debugging with a ""naked"" browser is problematic if possible at all.

* Cookies are basically OK. There is an opinion ""cookies are not RESTful"", although I still don't understand why.
Drawbacks: a bit problematic if you are going make REST calls from an application rather than from a browser. The application will have to handle HTTP cookies the way browsers do.

I forgot to mention (and I'm sorry about that) that one of the requirements is the ability to use the REST service from 3rd party applications.

**UpdUpdate**: the reason for various ""ideological"" limitations in REST, including cookies, is caching, load balancing and scalability. With some caution cookie-based service can be scaled, though it's not trivial.

All in all, the best solutions involve somewhat costly hash calculations on both sides. What's achieved in return is good separation of the data layer allowing access from both browsers and apps and at the same time maintaing user authentication with some reasonable level of security.",programming

Why are password lockout thresholds so low?,"At work, a lead engineer made this point:

* The point of a password lockout is to prevent password guessing by an attacker.

* Every time a password lockout forces the legitimate user to perform a password reset, the password lockout has failed (remember, its goal was to stop bad guys, never good guys). The system has just performed a DoS on itself. This can be easily used by attackers to intentionally DoS your system by randomly guessing passwords, and so a too-low lockout is a security vulnerability, not a strength. Also, password resets are themselves a security hole in any system. The more common they are, the easier it is to exploit the reset process itself.

* The correct way to pick the number of tries before lockout is pick a number that is above the number of times a legitimate user will guess before performing a password reset, but below the number of guesses an attacker needs to guess before having a statistically significant chance of actually guessing the correct password.

There are lots of ways to work out that number. It depends on how complicated your passwords are required to be, and how random they actually are. But let's take a simple case with very conservative numbers:

* 7 letters, lower-case only, no numbers, no symbols
* Total space = 26^7 ~ 8 billion
* Expected guesses in order to have a 1 in a million chance ~ 8000

No legitimate user is going to come anywhere near 8000 tries before giving up, so even with all the safety margins above (a very small password universe and a 1:1M chance of guessing), the limiting factor is the user, not the safety margin.

My usual recommendation is around 25-100 for this setting (assuming some minimum ""strong password"" requirements). Anything below 10 definitely hurts security more than it helps.

If you set it over 50 or so, then a password lockout should be highly suspicious, and should notify admins to investigate. This many attempts means someone is trying to brute force your passwords, or there is a program that is repeatedly trying to login and needs to be fixed. You only get this benefit if you set the threshold high enough that there are very few false positives.",programming
"Proggit, please help me understand the Y Combinator","Okay, so here it goes. I been delving into functional programming, and I can't really understand the Y Combinator explanations that have been given to me. So I decided to try and understand it by thinking about it and trying to create my own way to get anonymous recursive functions.

So here is what I have ( and hopefully not *too* far away from the Y Combinator):

you have a function f(x) that you want to make recursive, for this example, i'll use the classic factorial function.

So factorial is defined as:

    fact(n):
        if(n=1 or n=0)
           return 1
        else
           return n*fact(n-1)

Since we do not have named functions, we'd get:
       f(x):
        if(x=1 or x=0)
           return 1
        else
           return n*??(n-1)

Now, I thought of creating another function, which takes the function we want to make recursive like so (x=higher order function, n=factorial to compute):
       f(n,x):
         x(n,x)

Now the x function can call itself, since you passed the same function as an argument. 

 So all we would have to do is call f with x being the anonymous factorial function we want to make recursive, along with an extra argument. So this is what my final factorial would look like:

    lambda(n,x):
       if n&lt;2
           return 1
        else 
            return n*x(n-1)


Now all I have to do is call f with the anonymous function I just created ( f could be an anonymous function itself), and voila, we have a recursive function.

However, this is as far as I've gotten, the Y combinator does some extra steps, and it ends up with functions with only one argument, that I can not understand....


Please help me derive the Y Combinator from what i've got until now ( or  if I'm totally off, correct me)

Thanks Proggit!",programming

jQuery function question - calling function from a $.post call,"Hi, I'm new to jQuery and am struggling with calling functions from different pages. Here's an example:

      doSomething();
    });

    function doSomething() {
      // do something

On the page that calls this file I have:

    &lt;div class=""myDiv""&gt;Do something&lt;/div&gt;

This works with no problems. Now if I use $.post to load another file into a div on the original page and the new file also wants to call doSomething it does nothing.

If I call the function using the old school method:

    &lt;div class=""myDiv"" onclick=""doSomething()""&gt;Also do something&lt;/div&gt;

Ask Reddit: How big to agile projects get? What're the largest?,"A few months back Tim Bray mused that agile teams have been eating enterprise teams for lunch. They seem to deliver more quickly and fail less often.

But how much is this merely a function of project size? Decades of ""old school"" software engineering has mapped out the fact that project size -- in features, requirements, function points, SLOCs, $ budget, you name it -- is the single most predictive factor for project success or failure.

So could it be that agile projects succeed not due to the processes, but because they seem to focus on small projects?

This is a falsifiable hypothesis, I think. The trick is to find large agile projects for comparison with industry metrics on more conventional projects. Are the largest agile projects in the tens of thousands of SLOCs? 100,000s? Millions?

the &amp; operator in the middle is a logical AND (so 0&amp;1 -&gt;0 and so on...)

b=0x03 returns the value of b (0x03) = 3 = 011

the last step is 11 &amp; 10000000 which is something i dont really understand.

but i assume all of the above is wrong but i just wanted to show you i have tried to come up with a solution by myself and not just use you guys as my personal calculator :)

Ask Proggit: How many professional programmers on reddit work from 9-5? How many have irregular schedules?,"It seems like a lot of the people I've met who program for a living have the privilege of working on their own schedule as opposed to the standard, 8 hour shift for five days a week.  A friend of mine from college recently got a PHP programming job where he can work from home on Tuesday's and Thursday's, and he says he can pretty much get all his work for the day done before noon those days.

I understand the C++ language but I don't know how to write software,"I myself know the C++ language and it's features, its inheritance, polymorphism, templates, dynamic memory. I've read well regarded books like C++ Primer but I don't know how to construct software. That is I ""can not"" write substantial aplications.

Currently my projects are simple 32 bit console applications, recently I wrote a simple String class. But I don't know how to write large projects or use API's.

I hate this limitation, so I ask the community if they could recomend a friendly API or SDK or book that doesn't teach the C++ language but teaches you how to use the C++ language for creating applications with substance or with some real world importance.


EDIT: If you want to recomend another language that would be helpful aswell, I was thinking possibly trying out RUBY and learning web development, but ultimately whatever language you recomend I want to create useful applications.",programming
Proggit: Why Do People Hate Java?,"from where i'm sitting, Java seems to be falling out of favor in the programming community. indeed, most people seem to be developing a strong negative attitude to the language, the intensity of which surprises me. why is this?

is it the language itself? personally, i like Java, and i find that it lets me write good software quickly and easily. what do you guys think? do the missing features -- for example, first-class functions and lambdas -- get in your way? do you just hate explicit typing, or static typing in general?

or is it the jobs available with Java? most Java jobs involve working in a soul-sucking corporate environment, with other programmers who don't know what they're doing, for an ""architect"" who's pedantic and overpaid.

either (or another!) answer is valid, but i'm interested to know why Java seems to be falling out of vogue. if it's the language, that's fair, but i want to understand why; if it's the environment, that sucks, but it doesn't seem fair to condemn a whole language because of the way it's used.",programming
Looking for a simple means (read: language/environment/libraries) of manipulating and animating a lot of pixels without lag.,"I've played with moving pixels around for things like particle demos and animated, interactive image manipulation toys, but the languages in which I've done this aren't very low level and are quite slow. I'm not a *real* programmer, though I've dabbled here and there in a dozen or so languages (perl, python, c++, javascript, actionscript, various flavors of basic, even toyed in assembly). My math-fu is sadly weak, so anything that automatically handles e.g. 3D camera movements would also be nice.

I feel like I need to harness the graphics card directly to go any further, as things I create these days might need to push around millions of pixels interactively, and I get &lt;1FPS. Is there anything fairly simple out there that really screams through pixel transforms, but is accessible to a non-guru? I'm on Linux, if it matters. I kind of wish I could just get Processing to work through OpenGL, as it's easy enough to write something quickly in there without needing to be a CS major. Thanks.",programming

Artistic schools devote much time to studying existing masterpieces of art. Why don't programming colleges do the same?,"Why isn't there a programming discipline named like ""The design of great programs""? Or is there? 

I think such a course is almost vital: imagine composers, artists or architects studying their craft by only reading books and doing exercises, as programmers do.

It also seems like demand for such a discipline definitely exists: people (at least at reddit) often ask ""where can I read some great code""; there appear popular books like ""Beautiful code"" and ""Programming pearls"".

Warning: If you find an exploit in a popular web-based strategy game and share the details expect to hear about it for months after it has been patched.,"I don't know how many of you are familiar with the game Empire Craft.  Basically a web-based grind game where you try to build the biggest empire, join guilds and take out other empires.  I played back when there wasn't really much to the game but it was enough to get me logging in once or twice a day.

One day I was playing around with firebug in their arena store (you exchange points from winning battles in the arena for items and equipment).  I ended up finding the buy function which took two int parameters.  I looked up the full definition in their script file and it was as follows: buy(itemId, cost).  With some more digging I grabbed the ajax call that bypassed some checks, a prompt and just gave me the item I requested.

After a couple hours I had a set of max level characters and one of every item in the game (including ones they charge absurd amounts for as a part of their e-commerce shenanigans).  This ruined the game for me since there was no drive to see what the end-game was like after I rolled over it in an evening.

The next day I had a couple emails from their gm team saying ""There has been a glitch in our software and it accidentally awarded you several level 70 characters.  If you delete them we'll give you several epic hereos, equipment and resources.""  I let them know that it wasn't a bug but rather a hack and that I'd gladly explain the details and they can simply delete the account.

Long story short... they didn't delete the account, I haven't played much since but I am still getting emails from other players with ""How did you do this?????  Can u show me. etc...""  Today I got a message on reddit from someone who created an account just to ask how to hack the game.

tldr; I hacked Empire Craft Sept 09 and am still getting emails from players asking how to hack the game.

Here are some pics:

Anyone run into this c++ problem?,"I have a class called GenomeSeq that has a massive string called sequence.
Then I have a class that is called GeneSeqs that has a bunch of objects called Seq that are comprised of char pointers to a specific character within the string I discussed earlier - sequence.

I checked the main string, sequence, and it is absolutely fine! Infact all the other Seq objects work just fine. Only the ones that points to character indexed at 0 have this weird problem....

Copy the code above into your address bar or make a bookmark of it. You can run it on a user page to see that user's comments, or run it on any reddit page and it'll prompt you for a user. The dots on the grid are **clickable**, they'll open another tab with the actual comment you click. Don't worry about clicking exactly on the dot though; it just chooses the closest one to wherever you click. It also only shows the last 1000 comments, since that's as far back as reddit lets you list.

I've tested it in Firefox 3.5 and Chrome.

The bookmarklet uses the reddit api and an HTML5 canvas. It you want to see a prettier version of the code, paste it in here and check it out. If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions for improvement, please let me know. Enjoy!

The problem is when I look at the page in Chrome, *sometimes* the page is really wide. The page itself looks okay and lines up okay, but there is a horizontal scrollbar. And then, sometimes, when I simply refresh, it's gone.

I can't replicate this glitch in Firefox, Opera, Safari, or IE. But since Chrome is my main browser, it's driving me crazy.

If anyone cares to take a look at my code and help me figure out what's wrong, I'd more than appreciate it. Just let me know how I can repay you. ._.

For the record, I modified this theme.

* Bokake.com

* style.css

* Current, modified version of Wordpress theme, rar'ed

**EDIT:** Going to sleep now, but I promise I'll respond in the morning if anyone out there was kind enough to help. Thanks!",programming
Creating a color class (CColor) as a newbie project. What would you expect from a class that represents a color?,"Right now, I have:

**Properties:**

* Red
* Green
* Blue
* Hue
* Saturation
* Value
* ColorInteger (color as simple integer/long value)

**Methods:**

* Darken ( Amount )
* Lighten ( Amount )
* Desaturate ()

Any other ideas? I plan on learning by writing classes that I can use later one once I'm better, and I want to make them as good as possible to avoid having to rewrite them too much later on.

I've already written a pretty good string class which acts just like a string from Visual Basic 6 since that's the language I'm coming from. I probably won't use that one though since the C++ STL string seems pretty comprehensive.

I plan on making some other ones afterward: Animation, Date, and other redundant/probably unnecessary classes for the sake of learning.",programming
"My gift to /r/programming: rd - the command line 
reddit viewer (Windows)","I wrote this for myself and figured I might as well share. It allows you to browse reddit, with subreddit and comment support, from the command line.

**My motivation**

* Coworker who sees me looking at something in a browser: ""Glad you're not busy; I need you to do this, this, this...""

* Coworker who sees me staring intently at a command prompt: *backs away slowly*



It's written in C#. Uses .NET framework 3.5. I could've used 2.0 to widen compatibility, but LINQ to XML makes RSS parsing so much easier. It works exclusively with reddit's RSS feeds, which sort of hinders it's capabilities. For instance, it doesn't have access to votes or anything like that. Also, comments don't get nested (although they are in the correct order, so they are readable).
