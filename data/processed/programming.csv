"Programmers, do you put your comments (before|after) the related code?","Inspired by: 

In the several years I've been writing code, I have never seen someone write comments after code until that comment. The thought of doing that had never occurred to me either. 

On reading the comment's code snippet, it seemed to make more sense to me having the comment after the code. Ie, ""here's the code, now we'll explain"" instead of ""here's what's going on, now here's the code"".

Do you put your comments before or after your lines/blocks of code?",programming
Anyone want to give some good 'finding a job' tips to a soon-to-be-minted CS degree holder?,"I'm approaching the end of my junior year of college. I already have a really nice job with serious responsibilities that is completely unrelated to software engineering.

Should I try really hard to get an internship for the summer and abandon my job, or is intern experience irrelevant? Does anyone have any links to good resume writing for software engineers? Should I find an open source project and start contributing immediately? How does the job market look for those starting out? I have met a couple young software engineers and they seem to be doing OK, at least compared to a finance friend who is working at Walmart =(

I attend a very good school and will most likely end with 3.2-3.5 GPA and a second degree in Latin.",programming

[I am new to reddit, so please pardon any breach of protocol.]

We're working on a project involving channel allocation in wireless cellular networks. We're basically trying to find a newer, efficient algorithm for channel allocation. I'm trying to find a program which will help me simulate a GSM network - network towers, cells, users in a cell, users moving between cells, etc. The allocation algorithm in a cell, of course, should be programmable.

Collaboration? Visualising disease spread on social networks generated from Facebook.,"Hey reddit. I'm a mathematical epidemiologist specialising in modelling the spread of infectious diseases (flu, HIV, malaria etc.). I've had an interesting idea for a side project on how diseases spread through social networks based on data from Facebook.

I can do all the maths and visualisation stuff, but don't know how to actually get the data off the net. What I could do with is for someone with appropriate programming skills to help me write a bit of code read the URL of a facebook page and then get the URLs of all their friends and so. Ideally I'd like to this in R as that's what I do my analysis with. Given that information I could do some cool things. I could even make you pretty pictures of what your friendship network looks like.

Heres a rather old movie of the spread of a curable STD such as gonorrhea on a simulated sexual contact network. I'd like to do something similar and better on a Facebook derived network.



Would really appreciate any help or feedback.",programming
What is the best IDE for open source projects?,"I have had a rough and tumble relationship with IDE's. I started with textpad, them made my way to emacs, then used Eclipse for various java projects, and now I use XCode for everything except Java.

So then, is there an IDE as fully featured as XCode, but built for open source projects?

Just got this email from Google...Thought I'd Share,"Dear Google Apps admin,​

In order to continue to improve our products and deliver more sophisticated features and performance, we are harnessing some of the latest improvements in web browser technology.  This includes faster JavaScript processing and new standards like HTML5.  As a result, over the course of 2010, we will be phasing out support for Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 as well as other older browsers that are not supported by their own manufacturers.

We plan to begin phasing out support of these older browsers on the Google Docs suite and the Google Sites editor on March 1, 2010.  After that point, certain functionality within these applications may have higher latency and may not work correctly in these older browsers. Later in 2010, we will start to phase out support for these browsers for Google Mail and Google Calendar.

Google Apps will continue to support Internet Explorer 7.0 and above, Firefox 3.0 and above, Google Chrome 4.0 and above, and Safari 3.0 and above.

Starting this week, users on these older browsers will see a message in Google Docs and the Google Sites editor explaining this change and asking them to upgrade their browser.  We will also alert you again closer to March 1 to remind you of this change.

In 2009, the Google Apps team delivered more than 100 improvements to enhance your product experience.  We are aiming to beat that in 2010 and continue to deliver the best and most innovative collaboration products for businesses.

Thank you for your continued support!

Sincerely,

Ask Proggit: How do you get your PL/SQL in to version control?,"I work on many client's databases and do a fair bit of Oracle PL/SQL development. One issue I have is keeping PL/SQL code backed up in a consistent way.

Some of my devs will save their packages/procedures to text files and add them to version control on their own. But this gets messy, and it's very tempting to just load the procedures from their IDE and start deving from there. Before you know it your procedures on your drive are out of sync with what's in your schema.

I was hoping there would be a tool that would dump a schema's procedures/package DDL, then auto-add it to subversion. I've built something like this where twice a day I grab all the pl/sql ddl and throw it in a text file to archive. I haven't added it directly to SVN yet, but that's just a matter of a shell script. I was hoping there would be a more standard tool though, since that seems a bit hacky.

Using the database backups has it's drawbacks -- no easy way to diff/restore, etc. Plus you have to deal with the DBA's to even look at a backup, yeck.

Proggit: Do you use a different keyboard layout for programming?,"I´ve always found the German layout better for correspondence and the American one better for programming.

Does HipHop make PHP a proper language for developing applications reserved for Erlang?,"The following is from HipHop: What you need to know:

See, we all know that `*this*` should turn into `&lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;`.

Why the hatred for Visual SourceSafe?

"Wasting time on ""Hello, world""; programmers want user-friendly software too.","I've wanted to learn Clojure for some time now, and I finally got around to it today.  Here's how I wasted my last hour:

1.  Look around the internet for how to install Clojure.  Apparently there is no installer, no downloadable packages, no nothing easy.  The installation methods generally describe downloading a jar, downloading a java command line tool, writing a bash script to clean up calling Clojure.  WTF!  I want to install Clojure, not complete a twelve step program!  None of the installation methods look particularly hard, but if I have to write code to install your program, you've done something wrong.  I'm considering choosing a method of installing when it hits me: `sudo apt-get install clojure`.  Viola!  It works!  It would be nice if this was anywhere in your installation instructions...

2. So now I want to write hello-world.clj.  To Google!  ""clojure tutorial"" turns up a bunch of stuff using the REPL.  REPLs are great for trying stuff out, but they aren't great for tutorials: if I have a thorough understanding of your type system but can't write a program that outputs ""Hello, world"" to the screen, my knowledge is useless.  Back to Google!  ""hello world clojure"" turns up some nonsense about installing a whole build system to create a simple application.  No, I don't want Maven, I want to run hello-world.clj!  But this gives me the basic idea of code at least:

    (defn main [args]
        (println ""Hello, world""))

3.  Or does it?  `clojure hello-world.clj` does absolutely nothing.  No error, no nothing.  I try a few things out, including writing up the Java harness the author of that tutorial mentioned.  Nothing works.

4.  Beaten, I finally turn to Stack Overflow.  I write out a question about running Hello World in Clojure and get a hit off the duplicate detector.  The question mentions a simple program:

    (println ""Hello, world"")

5. Could it be that simple?  I edit my `hello-world.clj` and run `clojure hello-world.clj`.  It works.  FML.

Lessons:

1. Have an easy method of installation if your program is anything more than a single file.  On Linux, that means at the very least having a .deb available; ideally users should be able to run `apt-get install` to get your package.  On Windows that means having an .msi or similar.  These things aren't hard to make and should be doable for any mature product.  (I am not mentioning Mac because I haven't used Mac since 2005 and don't really know what the state of the art in Mac installers is).

2. Tell people what's available.  Even if your installer has advanced to the point that people can install it simply by willing it to be installed, nobody will do that if you don't tell them they can.

3. Don't start with the REPL.  REPL's are an excellent learning tool, but they aren't why people want to use your language (with exceptions for shell scripting languages like bash).  People want to use your language to run programs.  So at least show them how to run a simple ""Hello, world"" from a file before moving on to the REPL.

Personally, once I know enough Clojure to not make an idiot of myself, I'm going to try to fix the Clojure tutorial situation and make a decent installer for Windows (hooray open source!).  But Clojure isn't the first programming language I've run into that had these problems.  So please: if you're writing a language, make it easier to get started with!  Programmers are smart and can get around this stuff, but we appreciate when you make our lives easier.",programming

Do note that I deal with PHP and javascript 90% of the time. Understanding the code and sprinkling a few print_r/var_dump works in 99% of cases, imho.

H.264 - Why should it be free for people to capitalize on?,"I'm not quite sure I understand the hate on this issue.  A group of companies put time and money into a technology, spent years on it seamless integration and adoption into hardware, software, and web services, and now they are supposed to give it away?  

If you spent your time as a programmer or engineer building something that you wanted to make money from, would you want someone taking it for free and making money from it instead?  I know a good number don't mind, but a good number do.

This is not a broken model...It's how companies make money.  It's how tangible goods work, it's how broadcasting works, it's how services work, and it's what the economy is built on.  Your time as a programmer is valuable.  If you do something, anything in the world, and you want to put food on the table and a roof over your head, you charge for it.  

Do you think Intel chips will be free any time soon? No.  Can you make your own chips and spend years and hundreds of millions of dollars getting everyone to use them? Yes.  Does that take a tremendous amount of resources (people who want to get paid, etc.) to do it? Yes.  But do you complain about Intel (or other for profit companies) being shitty for charging you? No.

"Do you find managing DNS records confusing?  If so, why and how would you improve it?","I'm rather comfortable with the DNS protocol and DNS servers (e.g., I discovered the $1000 security hole in djbdns, so managing DNS records feels pretty intuitive to me.  However, I know a lot of smart developers that can build really impressive web apps yet still find DNS confusing.

Now DNS as a protocol isn't _that_ conceptually different from HTTP (send a request, receive a response; intermediaries can cache data), and yet while HTTP servers have evolved significantly since their introduction, DNS servers have largely remained the same.  (Admittedly, part of that's because HTTP clients are significantly more advanced nowadays, but DNS clients haven't changed much either.)

So anyway, I think it'd be awesome to build a DNS hosting service that people actually enjoy using (similar to how there were a bunch of decent image hosting services, but now reddit loves to use imgur).  I'd love to hear if people had examples of what they've found difficult and/or tedious about managing their DNS records and any ideas on how to simplify it, or if they're content with how things are.",programming

"Freelance programmers, how do you organize your time to cope with many projects at the same time, and still have a life?","I recently became a freelance programmer, and I've been quite lucky. Too lucky, maybe. My 'problem' is that I've been offered many projects, and I would really like to take them all. Not because of money, but because they are all quite interesting and may open many doors in a future. Some of them are short (spanning a few months) and some of them are long lasting projects (two or three years). None of them allows me to hire someone myself.

How does your shop manage what goes into your code base? Mandatory code-review? Feature freezes? Complete testing frameworks?,"I'm looking for ideas to solve a problem we are facing at our shop.

I work within a group of six programmers, lead by our Fearless Leader who controls what goes into our trunk.  Our Fearless Leader is both a developer and a manager, and therefore is quite busy, yet he is the gateway for all code to enter the trunk of our repository.  In order for our new code to be included, a patch is created and emailed to everyone.  Someone is assigned to be the reviewer, an email thread goes back and forth until the reviewer is happy, and then when the Fearless Leader gets around to it, he makes any modifications and finally applies it.

This bottleneck has created a many month long backlog of patches that aren't pressing enough to warrant inspection by our Fearless Leader.  Old patches suffer severe bit rot due to the trunk changing since they were created.

We are at a point where it is clear a change needs to happen, so I though I'd poll the rest of /r/programming to see how you guys address the problem.

Fundamental problems in our approach from my point of view:

* The trunk should be for development and branches should be for stable code.  Not the other way around.

* A single code-review bottleneck impedes check-in progress, but can enforce quality.  Maybe full testing coverage could replace the need for an eyeball on each line.

* code-review by email is possibly not the most efficient/educational approach.

So how do you manage what new code is introduced?  Does it work?",programming

Who else feels like concurrency issues are like being punched in the face by an invisible man?,":-)

Just debugged the hell out of one, it took me completely by surprise when I found out exactly what I was doing wrong. Wasn't expecting it at all.

Oh well, made for a fun morning!

-------------------------------

The short version: on the WPF UI thread, while having a write lock acquired on a ReaderWriterLockSlim, I was iterating over a set of data and executing an update on it. The update raised an event to some higher level UI code, which eventually called back down into the level the lock is used at - except it was trying to acquire a read lock. Problem was, I was still technically in the midst of that write lock, and I had explicitly set the lock recursion policy of the lock to disallow acquisition of locks recursively. Thus, BOOM.

As with most concurrency issues, though, it appeared to have a completely different root cause, and took awhile to sort out.

I broke my biggest rule: do **as little as possible** when you're in a lock. It looked like it was doing as little as possible from the code that used the write lock, but I failed to anticipate how it would be used in this case. Lesson re-learned, haha.",programming

Anyone know of a middleware for CouchDB or MongoDB that serves as a proxy filtering unauthorized queries/updates?,"I am asking because apparently the view system/query/etc. at least for CouchDB is very rich and functional and the documentation makes it sound as though a middle layer is not even necessary.

So there needs to be some middle layer -- but all I really need it to do is authentication and then drop requests that are attempting to access a different user's data.  Besides that it should just send the requests directly to the db.

Ask Proggit: What source code search tool do you use?,"As a general question, what tool do use for searching you code? How do you love it\what annoys the hell out of you about it?

Why I'm asking: I'm currently refactoring our companies internal development processes, which included switching the version control system to one that Sybase stopped developing in 1999 (anyone heard of ObjectCycle? No, didn't thing so...) to subversion. Currently our 'source catalog' consists of a MSSQL server with a database for each code set, and a legacy indexer which use string-position parsing to parse the syntax. The indexer drops each database every time it runs, and takes about 4 hours to go through a set of code. Any time it errors on its overnight run we are left without the ability to search through our source until we can get it running again.

Obviously it's not the best situation. I'd like to switch to a better source searcher, but I'm unclear on all the options. What do you suggest? Are there any open source solutions I should be looking at? The source is PowerBuilder code (don't laugh, we still use that) and the code consists of roughly 7 million lines. I understand that no open source indexer would have support for parsing PowerBuilder syntax, why would they; I've already written a parsing tool and am looking for an indexer that it could easily fit into (its written in Python so a python indexer would be very helpful). Like I mentioned we use Subversion. Any suggestions would be very much appreciated.",programming

Using a utility to generate Java code to make my project more concise. Good idea?,"The project I'm working on requires me to write lots of repetitive code. For example, if I want to load a image file called ""logo.png"" in my code, I would write something like this:

    Bitmap logoImage;

    ...
    // Init
    logoImage = load(""logo.png"")

    ...
    // Usage
    logoImage.draw(0, 0);

    ..
    // Cleanup
    logoImage.release();

Having to write this code to use every new image is a pain, including having to specify that logoImage should load the file ""logo.png"". 

As I'm working on a Java Android game and images are used a lot in inner loops, I really want to avoid slow things like making virtual function calls and e.g. accessing arrays/maps/object fields when I can avoid it. Copying an idea from the Android API (the generated R class), I thought I could run a utility before compiling to generate some of this repetitive code for me. For example, the actual code in the project file would be reduced to just this:

    logoImage.draw(0, 0);

Using some command-line tools (e.g. grep, sed), I can look for every instance of ""&lt;Image name&gt;Image.draw(..."" and then generate the other required code automatically i.e. code to load/release the file &lt;Image name&gt;.png and declare ""Bitmap logoImage"" somewhere. This code could either be added to a new class or I could add placeholders in my code that told the code generator where to insert the generated code.

To display a new image, all I would need to do is just copy the image file to the right directory and add one line of code. Nice and simple. This avoid approaches like creating an array of images, defining labelled int constants to references the array and having to specify which filename to load.

Is this a really bad idea? It seems a bit of a hack but I can see no easier way of doing this and it does seem to drastically clean up my code. Are there any standard tools for doing this simple kind of code generation (i.e. the tool doesn't need to understand the meaning of the code)? Does anyone else do things like this to make up for language features?",programming
Which open source database would you recommend for this particular use-case?,"The database will store somewhat large documents (avg 10-60 pages) in both pdf and processed plain-text forms and a few key pieces of data about each document such as author, date, title, etc. Dozens (100?) of such docs will be added each business day and users will run ""alerts"" against the new additions and be notified of new documents matching their queries. 

We're thinking MySQL because we're familiar with it, but recent posts and other research make me wonder if MongoDB or CouchDB or something else might be preferable.

Also, the users' alert queries have to be run against the new docs each day, so the query time cannot be really long or it will act to limit the number of users of the system which is expected to grow into the many tens of thousands.",programming

"Reddit, is there already a solution out there for this programming problem?","I'd search for a solution to this problem, but I have no idea what the search terms would be.

I have an API where users need to call a certain method on an object, and the object has multiple users. I'd like to make it easier to debug which user is responsible when some user hasn't called the method. The naive approach is to have the users pass in their name as a string to the method and have the object record which users have the called the method. Then to debug, look at the list the object recorded versus the total list of users and take the difference. This might make sense for one object, but it has O(n) memory cost where n is the number of users.

So here's my idea. Give each user a UID number. Instead of passing in a string, they pass in their UID. The object stores a fixed-size hash of the UID. The next time an object calls the method, the object stores a hash of the combination of the old hash and new UID. When it comes time to debug (which it's perfectly acceptable to be a slow process), given knowledge of all the users UIDs, we can compute which combination of hashes would lead to the current stored value, and then we now have a list of users that called the method. Or we might have a couple of candidate lists sometimes depending on the quality of the hash, but that would at least narrow things down.

The problem is I have no idea how to go about choosing a hash. Ideally hashing the same UIDs in any order would result in the same hash so as to reduce the number of combinations we have to try to figure out the real list. And ideally it would minimize the number of possible lists corresponding to any particular final hash so as to most greatly narrow the possible problematic users.",programming
Ask Proggit: Is there a name for having a class with an owned thread that all method calls run on?,"Proggit,

I've found myself doing something several times lately in the application I've been working on (it's in Java if you care), and I was wondering if it had a common name or something so that I could see if anyone has written a library to make doing it easier.

I've been working on a project where I'm multi-threadedly traversing directories looking for certain files. If I find them, I write them out a database and keep going. I had a lot of threads blocking, waiting to write to the DB, so I made a DB Helper class. It exposes methods for executing various DB updates, but the methods just add the updates to a command queue. The run method just loops, executing DB instructions from the command queue, that way all the commands are getting executed on that target thread instead of the calling threads.

So, to finally get to the point... is there a name for this?",programming
"Programmers, sit your butt down.  I need to have a talk with you.","Programmers,
I am one of you.  I live and breathe code; it's what puts food on my table.  However, in a former life I was a DBA.  During those few years, I learned a tremendous amount about relational databases.  I learned how to properly design them and why doing so is critically important.  

I am absolutely sick of seeing 90% of the programmers I encounter using SQL databases as if they were nothing more than bit buckets.  And your fancy new ORMs only compound the problem by further abstracting you away from your choices in schema design.  So, please, at a bear minimum, please spend the next 30 minutes learning these few things.  You'll become a better programmer because of it.

- Understand the ""relational"" part of relational databases. This means that various columns between tables are interlinked using foreign keys](  Doing this will help keep your data consistent by preventing the data in two tables from getting out of sync, so to speak. If you use MySQL this also means you need to stop using the default MyISAM engine and switch to [InnoDB.

- Just like your favorite programming language, your database also uses various datatypes.  The next programmer who defines a column like this ""is_active VARCHAR(100) DEFAULT 'T'"" is going to get cock punched.  For those of you who think you're too smart for this tip, let me ask you this:  Are you storing IP addresses as VARCHARs?  Why?  It's just 32-bit integer written in dotted quad notation.  You save yourself almost 4x the storage space by using an INT column. 

- Understand normalization. Nailing this down will make it easier to figure out in your head how to represent the data you intend to store.  Normalizing your data will help reduce redundancy and enhance data consistency.  However, sometimes normalizing it to the extreme will affect performance and be a bitch to write code for.

- Read up on check constraints.  You stick these simple little logic checks on your column definitions and they work wonders at preventing bad data from getting into your DB.  I know that you write your code to prevent bad data from getting in, but simple little things like this act as a last line of defense.  And when your code is rewritten, refactored, or just plain hosed up by a dumbshit coworker, that last line might be your only line.

Thank you.  That is all.",programming

"Help, proggit! A minute ago I was a Developer - now suddenly I'm a Lead Developer, doing interviews!","Long story short: I'm the more experienced of two developers in a small 5-person web design/development agency.  We're snowed under with work and are looking for another junior developer.

Despite our differing experience levels the other developer and I have worked alongside each other up to now.  However, now we're getting another ""junior"" developer on-board the directors have asked me to become the technical lead for the development team, and want me taking part in the interviewing process for the new developer (starting in two days!).

I'm an experienced developer, and obviously I'm gratified to be given the responsibility, but I'm also pretty green at the interview process (at least from *this* side of the table!).

The directors are already more than capable of assessing things like teamwork and personality, so I'm mostly looking for people who have the ""right-shaped mind"" for development - people who are creative, innovative and pedantic enough to make good developers, and flexible and knowledge-hungry enough to stay up-to-date in the fast-moving world of web design.

Everyone has horror stories of ""technical"" interviewers who mistake single-answer brain-teasers and gotcha-style questions for good interview technique, so I was wondering if proggit could suggest their *favourite* types of interview questions.

Having had my fair share of inept or ridiculous interviewers I really want to do right by the interviewees.  As I said, I'm not looking for brain-teasers or ""you either know it or you don't"" questions - I'm looking for questions and/or sample answers that give you a flavour of their approach to problem-solving; that *illustrate how a person thinks*, rather than just whether they've read all the same logic-puzzle books you have.  

Does anyone have any particularly interesting/insightful questions they've been asked in an interview?  Or favourite types of questions they like to ask when they're the interviewer?

Or - more generally - favourite approaches they take to the interview process?

I am considering writing a software application. How do you suggest I license it?,"I have an idea for an application that is firstly totally sweet and secondly completely absent in the market. It is fairly simple, and I think it won't cut into my studies too deeply to write it. However, I would like to make some pocket money on this, so I've decided to ask my fellow programmers for some idea concerning licensing. 

First, some background: 

1. I will not make this an open source product. As much as I love open source and as much as I love using it, I'm a fallible human being who needs food, shelter, and occasional alcohol, none of which are free. So please, if there are any among you who read this just to tell me to open source it, thanks but no thanks. 

2. This idea is actually pretty neat. Everyone I've mentioned it to had exactly the reaction I was hoping for: ""Why the hell didn't I think of that?"" among the programmers and ""Ooh that would be useful"" among the laity. 

3. But it's not like this is the next photoshop, so I'm thinking the price will want to be low enough to be a cross between an actual purchase and an impulse buy, but high enough for me to actually make something from it. In other words, in the single digit range. 

Now, my main concern is: piracy. There is no way to keep people from stealing software, just as there is no way to keep them from stealing music. I do not want to be a dick and impose a draconian anti-piracy system because one, it would have to be based on my own cryptosystem (and everyone knows that those are the worst kind) and two, because someone will crack it eventually, and there's no need to build a false sense of security. 

What I was thinking is to have some sort of system with which a copy of the program can identify itself as having been pirated, at which point it will notify the user. Of course, the user probably doesn't give two shits about this, and if they *really* wanted to use my software they could, so the message would just have a ""Whatever leave me alone"" button. It's like nagware, but much more stoic. 

So what do you think? Any good ideas would be welcome.",programming

"Reddit, please help me with a simple batch file question.","I am trying to run a finite element program in ""batch mode"" whereby I can list the files in a .bat file and run this file to execute the commands, (run the models), consecutively. 

However when I execute the batch file, the program executes the commands simultaneously, causing as many instances of the program to execute as I have specified commands. What I want it to do is to wait for the program to complete running before executing the next command. Here is the batch file contents:

How does one become a good team leader?,"How do you handle work on a team project? When you feel like the other members are less competent or the team lacks organization do you go ahead and take the lead and ensure everyone is contributing at least something? I'm quite interested in how teams in the real world function. Ideally a team would include members skilled in different areas but I'd imagine that more often than not some team members are less proactive and competent than others.

Personal background: I've been coding on my own for a while now, but this semester I'm taking a software engineering course involving a group project. I did my best to involve all the other team members but while they appeared competent during our meetings when it came to the actual coding the team members made a few mistakes which cost me spending time rewriting a large portion of the code to submit the project by the deadline (damn you, NetBeans; I never hated you more) as well as documenting everything as no documentation was produced in the process.

I did not want to just march in and take charge as if I only wanted things done my way as I know from personal experience how annoying a self-proclaimed team leader can be. Every decision proposed I encouraged the team to discuss and offer alternative solutions for, and on a few occasions we went ahead with the, in my opinion, less optimal solution just for the sake of me not seeming like I'm craving to be a control freak.

I still have another project to complete with the same team. What would you advice as far as techniques to encourage and ensure contributions without anybody feeling suppressed or useless?",programming

A RedditClone written entirely in T-SQL in under 50 lines.,"TLDR: Screenshot is here: 
      
Ok, so we have a RedditClone in Qbasic, A redditClone in X86 assembly, and a RedditClone in LOLCODE.... What is left to do? How about a reddit clone in pure SQL. Thats right, a redditClone that runs entirely in a database.
   
So, I got to thinking...There has to be some way to invoke a SQL DB using CGI? I realized that if I wrote a simple bridge to invoke SQLCMD (SqlServers console), I could route requests to that using CGI.
   
So, I borrowed the bridge that was used for the Qbasic Reddit and tweaked it a bit to compile under MSVC.
   
		int _tmain(int argc, _TCHAR* argv[])
		{
			std::string piper;
			FILE* data = _popen(""sqlcmd.exe -S localhost\\SQLEXPRESS -U redditsql -P [PASS] -i reddit.sql -h-1"",""r"");
			for(char c = getc(data); c != EOF; c = getc(data))
			{
				piper.push_back(c);
			}
			_pclose(data);
			std::cout &lt;&lt; piper;
			return 0;
		}

I then setup my server to route requests to this bridge via CGI. This bridge would simply intercept the request, and then run reddit.sql on the database, then return the output back to the server.
   
Source of Reddit.sql is below:

		SET NOCOUNT ON;

		-- Send the header for CGI
		PRINT 'Content-type: text/html;' + CHAR(13) + CHAR(10);

		-- Comments are hax to suppress SqlCmds STDOUT messages
		PRINT '&lt;!--';
		USE sqlReddit;
		PRINT '--&gt;';	
		
		DECLARE @QS NVARCHAR(500);
		SET @QS = N'$(QUERY_STRING)';

		IF CHARINDEX('title=',@QS) != 0 -- Submitting a new post?	
			INSERT INTO Reddits ( Title, Link, Score) VALUES (
				REPLACE(REPLACE(SUBSTRING(@QS, CHARINDEX('title=', @QS), CHARINDEX('&amp;link=', @QS) - 1), 'title=',''),'+', ' '),
				REPLACE(SUBSTRING(@QS, CHARINDEX('&amp;link=', @QS), LEN(@QS) - CHARINDEX('&amp;link=', @QS) + 1), '&amp;link=',''), 1); 
		ELSE IF CHARINDEX('up=', @QS) != 0 -- Upvoting?
			UPDATE Reddits SET SCORE = SCORE + 1 WHERE SubmissionID = REPLACE(@QS,'up=','');
		ELSE IF CHARINDEX('down=', @QS) != 0 -- Downvoting?
			UPDATE Reddits SET SCORE = SCORE - 1 WHERE SubmissionID = REPLACE(@QS,'down=','');

		-- Header
		PRINT '&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Pure SQL Reddit!&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;

"short but sweet shell aliases, and global aliases (1-3 chars)","Short and cryptic as \*nix commands can be, few consist of just one letter (I found only `/usr/bin/w`, `/usr/X11/bin/X`, and `/usr/X11/bin/x` on OS X).

If you spend any significant amount of time in your shell then these are a gold mine. You won't believe how much of a time saver they are until you sit down at a box without them and have to type out the full commands. Saves your fingers too.

I also use a few 2 and 3 letter aliases but you have to be more careful about clobbering commands. Scripts you might run could blow up when `dc` runs, say, `git diff --cached` instead of a calculator.

I forget who, but someone in a video I watched online used single char aliases for common git commands. That makes a lot of sense for me too.

    # git
    alias a='git add'
    alias c='git commit'
    alias g='git'
    alias b='git branch'
    alias co='git checkout'
    alias d='git diff'
    alias dc='git diff --cached'
    alias g='git grep'
    alias m='git merge'
    alias s='git status'

    function e() {
        ""$EDITOR"" ""$@"" &gt;/dev/null &amp;!
    }
    alias et=""$EDITOR . &gt;/dev/null &amp;!""
    alias ec=""$EDITOR ~/config/"" # portable and important dot files, symlinked from $HOME
    alias ev=""$EDITOR ~/config/vim/vimrc""
    alias ez=""$EDITOR ~/config/zsh/zshrc""

    # i added them both to see which i liked better, and now i'm stuck with all of them
    alias u='cd ..'
    alias uu='cd ../..'
    alias uuu='cd ../../..'
    alias uuuu='cd ../../../..'
    alias u2='uu'
    alias u3='uuu'
    alias u4='uuuu'

It seems like more people are getting on board with zsh these days. We can have fun with global aliases as well. The biggest downside to these is that you'll really miss them when you can't use them for whatever reason. Ever wanted to alias a command you frequently use with `sudo`? With zsh you can.

    if mac; then
        alias -g apache2ctl=/opt/local/apache2/bin/apachectl
    fi

Where `mac` is a shell function at the top of zshrc:

    function linux() { [[ `uname -s` = ""Linux""  ]] }
    function mac()   { [[ `uname -s` = ""Darwin"" ]] }

My main stash of global aliases use uppercase characters but stay short and sweet:

    alias -g C='|wc'
    alias -g CL='|wc -l'
    alias -g L='|less'
    alias -g H='|head'
    alias -g T='|tail'
    alias -g G='|grep'
    alias -g SH='&gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1'

Aliases are surprisingly most of the interesting stuff in my zshrc, and I use them constantly. The rest is pretty basic, mainly just setting options. My prompt is simple but useful (I like single line prompts). Have a look if you want.

Ask proggit: Getting *out* of the game industry?,"*throwaway account...*

I could use your helpful advice, reddit hivemind. Here's my dilemma. I've been a professional game dev at a big studio for several years now, and I think I might be burned out. I'm utterly tired of the sequelitis, sick of shitty code quality and C++'s awful build times, frustrated by management decisions I don't understand, and exhausted by enormous stagnant codebases.

The most frustrating part is that I don't even feel like a game programmer anymore. The stuff I do at work is swathed in so many layers of indirection and ""process"" and our games are so uninteresting to me that I may as well be writing insurance software. The only big difference is that if I *was* writing insurance software, I could at least write my own little games in my free time and put them online. Because of non-competes, I can't even do that. All I want to do is make games and I can't, ironically because I'm a game developer.

As far as I can tell, my options are:

1. *Leave the industry.* Get some regular business programming 9-5 job and make games in my free time. The hard part about this is that I fear my skillset applies well for games, but little else. Will I be able to find a job when I know tons of C++ and C#, but not much about SQL, ASP.NET or server-side programming?

2. *Find a better game studio.* Working on smaller games that I do enjoy would probably be the ideal situation. The challenge is that it's hard as fuck to find another game job now because the economy sucks and the industry is shrinking. I'd have to move to a city that has more game studios, and I don't think the few studios that *are* hiring are interested in relocating someone when there's probably plenty of hungry local candidates.

3. *Go solo.* I think I've got a well-rounded enough skillset that I could probably kick out a couple of iPhone games on my own and maybe get by. Unfortunately, my financial and family situation doesn't let me be that entreprenurial. I need a day job with a steady salary and health insurance.

**Any advice on what I should do?** If you got this far, *thank you* for at least reading this. It's hard to describe how frustrating and emotionally draining what I'm going through is. At least knowing that someone else is even listening helps.

I understand that saying ""wah wah, I'm in the game industry and it's lame"" really makes me sound like a whiney bitch. I do know I'm lucky to even have a job, and things could certainly be worse for me. Try to keep in mind that the game industry may not be as magical as you may think. There's a reason turnover is so high.

"Hi reddit, here is Minimal, a small C-like scripting language i'm working on now and then :-)","For the last two years or so i'm writing a small C-like scripting language which i dubbed ""Minimal"". The name reflects what the language offers: the minimum stuff i consider needed (without being practically unusable :-) for writing scripts, mostly oriented to simple games (think something like a platformer, adventure game or visual novel) although i've also used it as a configuration system for an installer and it might be usable as a CGI with some extra native functions, but i wouldn't depend on that :-P

However until recently i had it lying around in my server in several .tar.gz files (for different ""versions"") until i decided to put it in a git repository. And until today i didn't even had a site.

Any comments, suggections, etc?

Also i would like to write some better docs and a reference. Do you have any suggestions on format or style?

EDIT: it seems the site wasn't clear about what Minimal is and what not, so i added an extra paragraph in the About section:

&gt; Minimal is not a language to write full programs in. Instead it is focused on being an embeddable extension language - a language that will be embedded in programs written in other languages (such as C) which provide hools (also known as extension points) that call Minimal scripts. Examples for this are games (for defining the game logic), IRC and Instant Messaging software (for writing event handlers, like capturing URLs, writing IRC games, etc), installers (for the installation script - ie. the steps that will be performed on installation and uninstallation), macro language for editors and similar programs, smart configuration files, etc.",programming

Request for Comment: Shared Key authentication in MySQL,"I have been using Shared Key authentication for SSH for quite some time, to eliminate the need for using a username and password each time I need to log into certain servers. It makes sense, as I can retain the same password for a user account on that remote server, even if my connection is being sniffed, as that shared key is linked to each system I generate it for, and is quickly revocable on the server side.

A while back, I had a conversation with a Sun employee, who works on MySQL. I had suggested that they implement Shared Key authentication in MySQL, for many of the same reasons that it's useful in SSH. They thought it was an interesting proposition at the time.

I brought it back up today, in an IRC channel, and one individual thought it was better to implement this via tunnelling, rather than handling it directly in the database server.

[[New to C++ and seeking help/advice]]: Question about Abstract Data Types (ADT) - I can haz foods 4 meh thoughts plz?,"First, let me provide some brief background information. I just changed from Mechanical Engineering to Computer Engineering at MSU. I am currently in CSE 232 (which is essentially programming 2). From programming 1 to programming 2 we switch from Python to C++. I am currently working on the second project and I have found that my professor's style doesn't work well with my ADHD, he tends to overwhelm me with information (in an attempt to be helpful) and it starts to confuse me.

For project 1 we made a program that allowed you to enter a ""bounding box"" using the following format:

Xcoordinate Xspan Ycoordinate Yspan

The program was required to test the follow: is the bounding box valid, the area of the bounding box, and the perimeter of the bounding box. Additionally, given 2 bounding boxes it had to tell: whether or not the 1st one enclosed the 2nd, whether or not the 2nd one overlapped the 1st, and is the 2nd one (above, below, leftof or rightof) the 1st. Basically, the project was to make the functions that made these tests and that provided a driver that accepted the input and tested out functions.

Ok, so now we come to project 2. Part of the goal of this project is to get some exercise in reusing code. What they want our program to do is to accept bounding boxes that are intended to represent different buildings on campus. So there will be a name associated with a bounding box, and the program will hold all of this information about the different regions. The user should then be able to enter commands such as: whereis Xcoord Ycoord and have it return the nearest bounding box name, howtogo Xcoord Ycoord RegionName and have it return how to travel from the coordinates to the RegionName, whereisR RegionName and have it return the regions coordinates.

These operations should all be pretty simple. What I am having trouble with is deciding the best way to store a large amount of regions and their information while maintaining a significant amount of ease in accessing/manipulating said information.

Some preliminary questions that were asked of us and got me thinking (and also somewhat confused) are as follows:

5.  What kind of ADT are you thinking of to model our GIS information and to support answering queries of the above types? Answer in English. (What data model and what operations do you need?)

6.  Sketch how each of the three query types above can be answered using the ADT you chose above. Describe the algorithm in English. Describe any support algorithms that you might share across the different types of query.

If someone would be willing to offer me a bit of direction/food for thought it would be greatly appreciated!

Quick question about OOP and Ruby,"I have just started learning Ruby.  Most of the coding I have done has been in procedural type of languages.

I am writing a program that takes an old IBM Cobol data file which has been dumped to a flat ASCII binary file and converting it into a MySQL table.  I have written the first program and basically it reads in the flat file an converting each record to a hash validating the data (note code for dealing with packed decimal was interesting) and then writes it out to a MySQL file.

The code is working and in the process of writing this first program I have learned quit a bit about Ruby's general syntax regarding Hash, date time manipulation, looping constructs, arrays and symbols.  As of right now the code it self does not really take advantage of OOP and I am now in the process of refactoring the code to be more object oriented so the coding of the remaining file conversions can reuse the code from this program.

My question: Is this normally how someone who has been raised in programming OOP would process this type of task or would they write the code in OOP fashion to begin with.

1. Design code procedurally -- Refactor -- OOP code
              or
2. Design code OOP

How to detect and cleanup (or ideally prevent) orphaned lock files,"I am writing an automated grader program for Linux.  It stores the grades in a file.  The idea is that students can log in to their account, run the grader, get their results, and record their grades, all without teacher intervention.

But, what if the program aborts improperly, without deleting the lock file?  Is there some way to avoid that, or do I have to just check for it, like with a cron job that checks if the lock file is older than a minute or so?

Weirdest C bug I've ever seen. Can anyone explain it for me?,"So I'm writing a quicksort in C for an assignment in my algorithms class. We're comparing different sorting algorithms, but my professor feels that rather than comparing runtime, which can vary across different conditions, we should be comparing array accesses.

So, while I've written my quicksort (with a fallback to insertionsort when the list fragment is smaller than a threshold) to return an integer representing the number of array accesses. However, when sorting a 500-element list overflowed an unsigned int, I knew I had a bug. The bug causing the overflow turned out to be something different (a += instead of an =, causing my count to be _really_ off), but while fixing that, I came across a different bug.

my insertionsort method had the signature:
unsigned int insertionsort(int * arr, int left, int right, int accessCount);

unfortunately, I forgot to include a return statement in the sort. Yet, this caused NO compile error (or warning, although I did not compile wiht -Wall). In addition, I was not ignoring the return value. In the calling code I was updating the access count (ie accCount = insertionsort(arr, left, right, accCount). This was getting a nonzero value that was always different, and usually a 2-digit number.

Does anyone have any idea what was going on? I have a guess, but I'm no guru. Could anyone tell me what was going on? I'd really appreciate it.

btw, for those interested, my guess is twofold. First, C will allow you to omit return statements in functions returning int. It must, since I write int main(void) or int main(char argc char * argv[]) all the time without return statements (I know, shame on me). Plus, I can only assume that the value it's ""returning"" in that case is just some random garbage left over on the stack. Does this sound about right?",programming

So I'm making an Internet Query Language (IQL)...,"**WHAT?** - I always thought programming should be as easy and intuitive as possible, while still being powerful. Query languages like SQL are a great way of doing that, but are a bit limited in that they can only operate on special databases. I wanted to tap into the biggest information source there is, the mother of all databases - the Internet.

**WHY?** - The internet mostly uses HTML for structure, which is great because it offers so much possibility to identify the data you need inside a page. As a programmer I've always found myself looking up info on it in different ways like a good-ol' browser, but often I needed to build some script to extract information into a database because the particular challenge was too daunting to do manually. Or simply because the information was there but not sorted in some useful way, or I wanted it grouped or presented by some other criteria. Dozens of scripts later I realized there should be easier, friendlier way to do this.

**HOW?** - Unlike a standard database, the internet is structured *hierarchically*, not in tables, but it turns out that's even better for working with data - sorting, grouping, selecting, joining can all be done more efficiently in a hierarchical model. And you can even simulate tables in it (&lt;table&gt; anyone?).

**SO?** - I've built a very flexible query language parser, which means I can use any syntax my imagination can conceive and have it parsable within minutes, but just because I can doesn't mean I know best how to, which is why I'm posting here. I would like to present the syntax I've devised so far as simply as I can, and hope I'll get ideas and constructive criticism on it.

**READY? AIM. FIRE!** - Here's a couple of examples of what some basic queries look like:

    GET ' SELECT a@href  
*gets all the links from a google search*

    GET '  
    SELECT #sortable_table_id_2 tr[td:first(:contains(""winrar"") || :contains(/^power\s*archiver$/i))]  
*gets the two rows from wikipedia comparing Winrar with Power Archiver*

    GET '  
    SELECT #sortable_table_id_2  
    ORDER tr BY td:contains(""YES""):count DESC  
*select the table of features sorted by most features*

    GET @url SELECT * LEFT JOIN (  
        SELECT li.critic_score AS critic_score, li.community_score AS community_score  
        FROM (  
            SELECT rowid, row&gt;th&gt;a@href ABSOLUTE_URL @url AS address  
        )  
    ) USING(rowid);  
*a somewhat more complex example*

These show very basic syntax like GET (there's also POST ... WITH BODY ..., HEAD, READ for local files, etc.), SELECT to extract nodes and their children (SELECT TAG does the same but only selects the tag not it's children, and recurses the search inside found nodes), ORDER *selector* BY *selector* [, *selector*], and selector syntax which is almost identical to CSS selectors (similar to jQuery's).

**WE DONE YET?** - Right now I've done this in C#, but once the framework is functional it should be easy to transpose in other languages. I'm sure it will be very useful once complete, just like SQL saves everyone a ton of time. I will provide more information in the comments. I welcome any questions, ideas and suggestions.

Edit: Here's a screenshot of work in progress

Edit 2: One of the major differences between IQL and SQL would be that, while SQL uses tables, IQL uses trees (hierarchical data). Tables can be emulated with trees (think &lt;table&gt; tag), and any operation SQL can do with a table can be emulated in IQL.

Edit 3: I've been asked if I have a twitter account where I could post updates on the project's progress. The whole code is in debug mode since I'm the only one working on it, so I'd have to do some serious cleaning before any code release. But I will do so as soon as I have the time, so I've created this twitter account if anyone's interested in getting info on it's progress - ",programming

- Learn a bit more about online marketing and other non-programming parts of a web based business. (Without the place being infested by marketers).

If my projects were open-source, I'd probably post them directly to reddit to get feedback.

Ask programming: How can I find the right developer(s) for my startup?,"I plan to found a startup company, and wanted to seek advice from some programmers here about where I can find the right developer(s).


I'm in the UK and plan to build a web-based practice management solution (client management, HR management, case management, time recording, billing and later to add accounting) for professional services firms. All in the cloud, and sold on a subscription basis.


What I need is someone to build the software. I want it to be truly great. I am not aiming to just bash this out as quickly and cheaply as possible by going to odesk or elance (unless you all actually think that is a good idea?!).


My aim is to get the software built, and then prove it by selling subscriptions to a handful of companies. I will then aim for venture capital to boost this to next level. I have some money to start this thing up and pay for the initial development. I also have a few ""ins"" to the market, so I think selling a few subscriptions will be easier than if I were to go into this cold.



*What i want to know is how I should approach the development… is it best to find an affordable programmer and pay them a contract rate to build this from scratch? My concern with this is that if they are affordable, they may not have a broad (or deep) enough range of skills to do everything; even if they think they can!*


*Perhaps I should find a top-notch software architect and pay them to help design the framework for the software. They could help break it up into smaller projects, which I could get freelancers to build to his specification.  Obviously it is appealing that I can hire freelancers from abroad to build this more cheaply. However, my concern about this (especially when they are abroad) is that it is difficult to communicate effectively, which can be a problem when working to tight deadlines and trying to build a truly excellent piece of software. I also worry that doing it in pieces will lead to a fragmented application, that doesn't feel like a single fluid piece of software.*


*Should I go for someone with academic qualifications/certifications, or just with a demonstrable portfolio? Someone who works regularly or someone that is currently out of work? Do they need to have worked on this kind of thing before, or can any good developer turn his hand to something new?*



About me: Although I don't have programming/development expertise myself, I have several years of experience building custom web applications, using freelancers. I have also been CIO of a multinational professional services firm for several years. I have the business credentials; what I'm looking for is how to identify and work with the right tech people to build it. I also don't want to have to pay an arm and a leg for it early on, since I will have nothing to sell and therefore no source of revenue, until the software is complete.


By the way - I'm not one of those assholes that is just looking for programmers to work for free on the promise of some future equity. I am planning to put cash forward for this. I would not even want to offer equity unless the developer(s) had something special to add to the company.


So reddit: what should I look for (or look out for), and where should I look? Give me some inside information, from the developers perspective. Thanks!

But this guy has made successful apps before and we had discussed the market for our apps in the past and considered working on one together.

So when the SDK comes out for the iPad, we both obviously want to get on the wave of initial apps, because you are guaranteed to make at least 10k in the category our apps are in (if the iPad does well).

Then he wants to rewrite his half of the app because he doesn't like the way he did the UI (hes a UI guy, im a data guy mostly). Fine. I was a little suspicious at this point, but whatever, let him do extra work.

Now today he comes on Skype and says that he is going to take over the app. His reasons being: time zones made it hard to work together (its only a 2 hour difference), xCode SVN was not working well so we had to manually combine code several times (I mean, we could have just set up git at some point but..), and he thought he could do the whole thing on his own (well no shit, you don't have a full time job).

Help Reddit - I need your advice!,"Right, where to begin.
**I'm a 17 year old developer.**

Have been coding since I was 12 and it's my lifelong passion. Absolutely love the rush you get when you solve a problem, fix a bug, you know what I mean. I dropped out of college when I was 17 (having only completed a year - UK education system) so was relying on my freelancing experience to get me a job.

Naturally, this extremely small company (3 employees) snapped me up. I explained what I wanted and they promised various things including a 6 month pay review (payrise), a £1500 ($2300) training grant per year (for books), and MCTS certification. The only catch was that the base salary was extremely low - £12,000 ($19,000). I had no problem with this as I was new to the industry, my skills weren't amazing at this point, and I was getting training and expertise out of the job at hand.

7 months later things are different. 
Payrise they promised me? Didn't happen. Still on £12k. 
MCTS? Nope. 
Training grant? Haven't seen a penny.
Heck, they haven't even given me a contract - I could walk out of here and they couldn't do anything. In the same way, they could fire me today and I'd have to go by tomorrow.

As for me? I've changed a hell of a lot. I'm now developing with C#, .NET, using SQL, Silverlight, WPF, WCF and I'm doing a damn good job because for near enough every day of the past 7 months I've been working my ass off to get better and better at what I do. I recently visited a developer conference - and I'm now getting more involved with the community, speaking at different conferences and usergroups all over the UK. 

I no longer believe this job is for me. I recieve no respect here and am treated as the lowest-of-the-low in the company. My bosses do not understand the amount of work I'm putting in and nor do they care when I show them. This is not an ideal workplace. 

**Example: I have a cold. My boss shouted at me yesterday telling me to 'sniff quieter'. No respect whatsoever. Tiny example, but not very nice.**

Right. Few questions then.

**What do I do now? Am I right for looking for another job?**

I've hounded at these guys about my concerns but they just don't seem to give a damn. The money isn't enough for me to live on anymore, I'm getting none of what was promised - and I only took the job because it was promised!

Right now, I think I spend about 40% of my day just doing paperwork. I have a MS Project license, and I'm trying to chart my various daily tasks on it.

For example: 

* I spend about 1/2 hour every morning doing email.

* I spend about 1/2 hour updating ticket statuses.

* I spend about 1 hour in conference calls.

* I spend about 1/2 hour after lunch doing email.

* I spend about 1/2 hour before I leave updating ticket statuses.

* I spend my last 1/2 hour doing email.

* All told, that's 3.5 hours a day that I'm doing administrative work.

So, I don't get a lot of time to do my actual work, **programming**. But, if I put in an estimate that it will take me 1 day to do a task, they expect that I will get it done in that number of work days, not 8 hours of coding. So, I need a good solution to track my time, so I can then track my actual work time, and then give estimates which represent my real world time, and not ""coding time"".",programming

"Simple but useful functions that nobody else
seems to use","Everybody knows the basics - split, trim, chomp, search, beginsWith, endsWith. But there are two string functions that remarkably few people seem to be aware of, despite of how incredibly handy they are for quick&amp;dirty HTML parsing (especially if regexes make you barf).



The first: `string between(string text, string from, string to);` returns the first match in text that starts with `from` and ends with `to`; separators not included. Empty `from =&gt; `match from start; empty `to =&gt; `match to end. This one has plenty of variations - rbetween matches first until to, then searches backwards for from; ibetween does case-insensitive search, betweens returns an iterator, etc.

Usage example: `string title = between(html, ""&lt;title&gt;"", ""&lt;/title"");`

The second one is a bit more generic: `string slice(ref string text, string marker);` searches `text` for `marker`; if it is found, it cuts `text` off after the marker, and returns the text before the marker. What happens if the marker isn't found depends on your needs; it can be quite useful to set text to `length=0` and return the whole text, but for now we'll assume it returns a null string.

Say you want to parse a command line parameter of the form ""--size=640:480"". This is how you'd do it:

    foreach (arg; args) { // or equivalent construct
      if (arg.beginsWith(""--size="")) {
        slice(arg, ""="");
        width = atoi(slice(arg, "":""));

"AskProgramming: Question on single precision 
IEEE754.","How many distinct numbers between [0,1] can be represented by a  single precision (32bit) floating point number?


I've read some of the specifications and tried to make sense of it. After some thought, the answer seemed to be very simple, and I'm wondering if it is wrong.

The reasoning:

1.0 represented by the float (shown in hex):
        3f80 0000

The numbers between 0.0 and 1.0 are in the range:
        0000 0000 &lt;-&gt; 3f80 0000

In other words 0x3f800000 = 1065353216_10 possible distinct numbers between and including [0,1]. Roughly 1.054*10^9.

Now... I'm thinking that the distance between each distinct number changes depending on the exponent. That is, higher accuracy for the numbers closer to 0, and lower accuracy for those closer to 1. Is this also correct? 


Perhaps one way of determining what the accuracy for each exponent, is through incrementing the exponent from 0x0000 to 0x3f80, and taking the difference from the significand set at 0x8000 and 0x8001. Though more easily, this could probably be done by going by the formula....

so each increment would be 
     2^-23 * 2^k, where k = [-127, -126, ... , -1, 0]

simplified:

    2^(k-23)

Multithreading memory access in C: question on theory.,"Help a non-programmer out with some theory:

I'm a mechanical engineer who is learning programming on my own. I've hit an issue that I don't properly know how to explain.

I have a really large array (250 MB) that needs some simple math done to it. I have created two programs: A single threaded application, and one with two threads (using pthreads on MacOSX).

Both do the necessary work, but the single threaded is three times faster than the multi-threaded (on my Core 2 Duo system). The single threaded system iterates over every element in the array, while the multi-threaded splits the array in two and each thread gets half.

This algorithm is very much memory bound. I was hoping that each thread could operate on independent areas of memory simultaneously. From this, however, it appears that the single thread preforms all of the memory operations in sequence, while the multi-threaded applications time-slice (with poor overhead), while sharing the memory bus.

Proggit: 2 days ago I posted a story about cooking pizza in the epoxy curing oven.  Here are the details from my dad...,"Here is what I posted a couple days ago.  I sent the OP link to my dad, and here's his reply:

\[bitter\_cynical\_angry\],

Thanks for the link -- it was very interesting, and reminds me of several head-scratchers I encountered over the years.

The story you mention involved hybrid circuits. These are small circuits which consist of very small discrete components assembled on a ceramic substrate. ""Wiring"" is metal, typically gold, fired onto the ceramic. Resistors are silk-screened and also fired, then usually laser trimmed to the correct value. But other components are put down onto metal pads like surface mount circuit boards, but using conductive epoxy instead of solder. The epoxy is interesting stuff, being a slurry of little metal, commonly silver, spheres, and resin. The epoxy is one-part, and non-conductive until heat cured. When it cures, the resin shrinks and the spheres are drawn into contact with each other, making the stuff conductive. It usually works fine if everything is extremely clean, but I sure had a lot of grief using it in a somewhat non-conventional application.

Anyway, the epoxy is put down manually or by machine, the components are placed onto the epoxy drops either manually or by machine, then the circuits are put on what amounts to a cookie sheet and into an oven at around 150C for an hour or two or whatever the epoxy requires for curing.

A mechanical engineer I worked with at Tek \[Tektronics, where my dad worked for many years\] had worked at an aerospace company that made hybrid circuits for some government project, and they had to keep rigorous reliability figures on test failures. There was a slight but noticeable increase in the failure rate, and he was tasked with finding the cause before the failure rate increased to the point where the line would have to shut down. They kept detailed records of all the production, and he ran some statistics on the failed parts and discovered that the failed units were predominantly being built on Fridays. So he hung around the production area one Friday to see what might be different about the production on that day.

What he found was that on Fridays, the assembly workers would chip in for a pizza. Then they'd put the pizza into one of the ovens to keep it warm. The outgassing from the pizza contaminated the circuits enough to affect the adhesion of the epoxy and cause the increased failure rate.

Next time you're by, remind me and I'll show you a couple of the hybrid circuits I designed. And if time is heavy on your hands, I'll tell you about my epoxy troubles.

Exploiting the 64-bit architecture to do bitwise operations in parallel.,"I'm too busy/lazy to write a full article on this right now, but I still feel like sharing.

On the 64-bit architecture, you can easily double the speed of a large number of bitwise operations on 32-bit integers by packing two integers at a time into one 64-bit integer, then applying your operations. (This can by used in cryptography, graphics, video encoding, and many other fields.) This requires no special hardware, software, or instruction set extensions other than a 64-bit processor and operating system.

Speed tests: (Fully optimized for speed using -O2)

    Vanilla implementation completed: 35.5 million iterations
    in 5 seconds.

    SIMD64 implementation completed: 66.2 million iterations
    in 5 seconds.

Of course, my code:

EDIT: I am aware that I screwed up my ""rotates,"" and that they do not function properly as rotates. The example still stands.

Ask Proggit: Recommendations on a stream flow control algorithm for a TCP-like protocol,"I am presently working on an open source p2p network protocol implementation, and I'm curious about what the latest and greatest thinking is on flow control algorithms. I could just implement TCP (more or less), but I'm wondering if there's something much better out there than how TCP typically does things.

Preferred characteristics:

 * Good all-round performance comparable to TCP
 * Simplicity of implementation, as stateless as possible
 * Better performance than TCP over high-bandwidth high-latency connections (e.g. U.S. to Japan, etc.) would be desirable if possible
 * Better performance than TCP over wireless is desirable if possible
 * Simplicity is somewhat more desirable than higher performance than TCP in marginal situations (e.g. high latency or wireless like above)
 * Less ""chatty"" is better... less ACK traffic, etc.
 * Not patented, free for use

So what's out there? Anything better than the standard TCP flow control algorithms? I've been searching Google Scholar and groups and such, but I'm curious about what the folks here know about.

My encapsulation protocol has encryption and message authentication, so the flow control protocol itself need not have any intrinsic resistance to tampering or DOS attacks. The encapsulation provides that already. This might allow for something simpler than TCP... maybe?",programming

How to Know Whether You're A Programmer or a Developer,"If you can't write something at least marginally useful in C, you're not a programmer.",programming
"I'm almost 22. I've finished 4 years of undergrad, now I realize I want to be a programmer. What do I do?","Long backstory, because I don't know any other way to tell it. tl;dr version is in the title:

I do well exceptionally on any standardized test thrown at me, I've always ended up at the 99% percentile. Even so, I ended up at a middling local university, as the price was right (~$6K a year), and it's a pretty solid place (University at Buffalo). I had 75 credits coming in to college thanks to taking 16 AP exams in high school, and  the plan was to graduate quickly with a physics degree and go on to law school, since hay that's where the money is.

Problem is, it turned out I really love programming, and the iPhone OS really inspires me to do work. I gradually started working on it in my spare time, and now it consumes an large portion of my spare time. Thanks to you guys and some effort on my part, I know an incredible amount about software engineering and less about computer science (I'd estimate probably a sophomore-level student). 

I'm ending up graduating with an economics degree this semester, but I have no idea what to do now. I *want* to pursue a CS degree, I was never particularly enthused by law – I did extremely well on my LSAT, but I know working at a law firm won't get me up in the morning like programming does/will. 

I've heard all sorts of conflicting advice, and no one seems to really be able to tell me what to do – the path of least resistance is to stay where I am and get a BS in computer science, but the thought of spending another two years in the absolutely soul-crushing emotional chilliness of my university and the physical chilliness of Buffalo isn't exactly appealing to me. I have the intellectual capability to be at somewhere great, but my grades aren't exactly 4.0 material; I have a 4.0 in my CS classes but that doesn't balance out the merely above average grades in the classes I hated and never went to (virtually every other subject). 

So, can you tell me what my options are given these constraints? Is my best option then to take a couple CS courses in the summer, some more in the fall, and apply somewhere for transfer explaining my odd situation? Or do I just need to hang tough and get my BS here because no one is going to transfer my 'general ed' credits, so I'll need to retake a bunch of humanities courses just to get a CS degree at another school?",programming
Ask /r/programming: Why is it not possible to use the same partition for dual-boot and a VM?,"As a primary Linux user who sometimes has to use Windows for various reasons, I am well aware of the pros and  cons of dual-booting vs. using a Virtual Machine. But here is something I have always wondered: why isn't it possible to do both with the same partition?

That probably doesn't make sense, so let me explain: When you dual-boot between two OS's, you have two separate partitions on your drive; one for each OS. When you use a VM, you have a file inside your primary OS's partition that contains within it a virtual partition that contains the virtual OS. It seems to me that it should be possible to set up a dual-boot system, and then add a VM with a virtual partition that would then go out to the disk and *mount* the physical partition for the other OS and boot it.

I think this would be the ideal solution. You would be able to choose between launching a VM into the secondary OS or booting it directly, but either way, it would be the *same filesystem*, so all of your settings and installed applications would be shared. You would only need to set it up once. Plus, if your secondary OS is one that doesn't like being run in a VM or being installed twice (like Windows), it would avoid that problem nicely.

So can someone tell me what is wrong with this idea? Is there some technical reason that it can't be implemented, or is it just that nobody has seen any reason to try?",programming
Proggit: I'm a Junior Software Engineering major and I've lost faith in my university's program.,"**The questions at hand...**

* What is a typical curriculum for an SE program?
* What knowledge/experience is expected of SE graduates?
* What can I do to improve my confidence in the field?
* What are the typical job functions of a software engineer?
* What should I absolutely know before graduation?
* How important is development (coding) experience versus synthesis/analysis (planning) knowledge? It seems that the courses focus more on the theory than the application. Is that typical?

**On a related note...**

* I've been looking for *any* type of internship relating to computers for about three years, and everything I've found falls through. I live in Ohio, go to school in Indiana. Any advice?
* I'd really like to learn Unix/Linux administration. Where is a good starting point?

I started with HTML/CSS in high school and shortly after picked up PHP, then Javascript (backwards, I know). My freshman year I learned C++ and Ada, both using basic OOP but only doing small-scale programs. Sophomore year covered Java and more OOP, though neither in depth. A project allowed us to make a choice of two languages, so I have also used Prolog and Scheme, *briefly*. This is my Junior year, and we had a larger (group) project assigned. I was responsible for the database backend and interface, which I implemented using Java and an h2 database. The member of my group responsible for the GUI basically didn't do it though, so the project didn't end so well. Next year will be my Senior year, and I'll have courses focused more on testing than development, and the final course is a Senior project and 30-minute presentation/seminar.


Most courses have repeated the same concepts of the ""Software Design Model,"" including specification, requirements analysis, coding, testing, maintaining. We've also talked about other methods like agile programming, extreme programming, and pair programming.


My chief complaints are that the professors in the department aren't convincingly knowledgeable/experienced, and that the courses don't require enough work to be comfortable in the languages.

I work for the school's web team, but that only consists of HTML/CSS/Javascript work with the occasional C# form. I'm beginning to worry that when I graduate, I'll be completely unprepared for what's expected of me when/if I get a job.


Any advice?

Rant about technical interview questions,"tl;dr Interview questions are stupid and irrelevant; discuss

I have been interviewing of late and I have a rant about the technical questions. I have been programming for a number of years and outside evidence from others leads me to believe I'm pretty good at what I do. Where I have problems is when the work drops off and tons of YAGNI requirements start popping up, engineers making up stuff to do and lack of business direction.

I don't have a mind for details so I don't write code that requires a lot of details in terms of configuration or whatnot. If you can get the code it builds with $ANT_HOME/bin/ant and the resulting .war (for example) deploys in tomcat (for example).

The interview questions about linked lists, bubble sorts, tree structures and detailed information about java.util.concurrent seem irrelevant for two reasons.

1) The number of times I've had to use any of these low-level constructs in my job(s) is close enough to be zero.

2) the speed with which I can google 'java bubble sort' and get FAR more than I would ever need about bubble sorts, obviates the need to commit these arbitrary details to memory.

Ill make this relatively short and finish with this. I have heard the argument that without the foundations of these low-level constructs you cant be a good programmer. And I argue that the reason every single job I have taken entails screwing around with TONS of cruddy legacy code is because 'bad' programmers, obsessed with low-level details are locked into one way of doing things without even understanding, at a high level, what they are doing and why. I attribute this to the idea that most of the time no one can even adequately explain the business model.

This is not entirely sour grapes. I took a job where I understood the business model and the work I am doing is debugging AS400 RPG code (I have zero experience with AS400 but its going quite well). I was given a surprisingly lucid explanation for the the cruddy legacy code I am working with and it makes it a lot easier to deal with than say ""oh our entire backend infrastructure is in PHP because the CTO was really intrigued with PHP and he wrote it in three weeks.""",programming

C-family language-embedded threading idea,"Hi fellow Reddit programmers,

I've had an idea for a while on how to create more ""natural"" threading within a language structure itself. I've found threading to be a bit of a hassle in most languages/platforms (C++ and Win32 is a cluster-fuck), while others pull it off decently well (Java/C# do it cleanly).

The basic idea is to take the existing block structure found in the C programming language family and have each block run as a thread, if defined to do so. Each thread, like a block, has local variables, as well as can access variables found in higher scopes (for shared variables). Mutexes are hidden and automatically binded on variables used by more than one thread.

There are a few things still open in the air, such as the syntax associated with manipulating threads (i.e.: stopping or joining) from the main thread, as well as how threads can spawn off child threads, but I'm just toying with it.

Some sample theoretical code:

    int main()
    {
        // Simple ""bucket"" variable that is subtracted by 1 from
        // thread_a, and when set to 0, thread_b stops
        int bucket = 5;
    
        // Start a thread, named ""thread_a"", that subtracts the
        // ""bucker"" integer by 1 each second for 5 iterations
        thread thread_a
        {
            for(int i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++)
            {
                bucket++;
                Sleep(1);
            }
        }
    
        // Start a thread ""thread_b"", running in parallel to ""thread_a"", that subtracts
        // a single value from the shared variable 
        thread thread_b
        {
            // Check if bucket is set to 0, if so, exit thread
            while(bucket != 0)
                Sleep(1);
        }
    
        // Finished! All threads must complete to reach here
        return 0;
    }

Any and all feedback is much appreciated, so let me know what Reddit thinks!

**Edit:** Looks like a few compiler specific environments introduce this block-style threading approach. OpenMP]( does a good job of only adding to the language to support block-style threads, while [Cilk is a C-like language with language-level support. Cilk seems to be almost everything I was looking for, so I'm glad my idea has already been tested and implemented. I'm very surprised Cilk's design is used more often / is more popular.

After one week of trying to follow Agile Web Development with Rails (3rd ed) book, I stopped after realizing I don't really understand what the author's making me type.

I've heard good things about Ruby and I really want to learn it. Any suggestions? Should I focus on Ruby first, framework later?",programming

"Ask Proggit: So, I'm a newb and tend to nest for's and if's extremely deep. What am I doing wrong?","I have no traditional training in programming, I just kinda teach myself through trial and error. Already looking back at some old code, I realize I have done some odd things that I already know to be horrible, horrible practice.

For example, say I'm doing some Django work and have several ManyToMany fields of books for every user, I loop over one list, and then another, and another and another to find matches (often caching the queries first, or else it hits the DB n^2 times)... it's a mess. What am I missing?

Here's the link

It works by replacing randomly selected words on the sites you visit with translations from Google Translate.  The translation is done without regard for context so it's not going to help with your grammar and verb conjugations, but I've been using it for a week now and it seems to be a pretty good way to build vocabulary.  You can mouse over the translation to get the original word if the context isn't enough.  I'll probably add transliteration support and some basic word-joining functionality as soon as I'm convinced that the existing features are stable.

A few questions for programmers about finding a job coding.,"Hello Proggit! I am currently a Computer Science Junior and am curious about how to go about finding a job in programming in the future. I see all of these job postings requiring 2-5 years of experience for such-n-such language everywhere. Languages I know pretty well are C, C++, and Java. 
Even though I have been coding C++ for 4 years now, I don't feel it accurate to say I am fluent in it and that is the language I am most familiar with. So I have a few questions for Proggit:    
1.) How do you know that you know a language well enough to apply for jobs in that language?    
2.) If I saw a posting for 2-5 years C# experience, would it be a common thing to apply for the job and then teach myself the language in a weekend since I am already familiar with the mother languages? Does my C++ experience have relevance when applying for jobs in C#/PHP and similarly structured languages?    
3.) Extending the second question, if that is not a common or acceptable thing to do, is it a better idea to list on my resume something like 4 years C++ experience, new to C#?    
4.) One thing constantly reinforced in my classes is that if you know one language and the CompSci theory then you really know all languages. So is it normal to teach yourself a language over the weekend then go apply for a job in it? If so... where are these jobs?    
5.) Is this the type of job where networking is the only real way into it, or is it reasonable to just call the places you want to work and ask if they are hiring?    
Thank you for reading this post Proggit I am confident that your responses will be informative. :)",programming

I graduated at UFPR, a Brazilian university. The CS course was nice, but I'm quite sure it's not among the top. So, I consider myself a mediocre systems analyst that happens to still remember some of that damn ""Concrete Mathematics"" book. 

I currently work for a government-owned IT company. I like my job. Actually, I've been working with this for so long I can't see myself doing anything else. This is where things get strange. I decided to apply for a university entrance exam for a Biology course - at UFPR. I just did so because my wife was doing it and I thought ""What the hell, I'll do it too"".

So, I wasn't going to try it, but now I realize I have the chance to actually do something different. However, it's really weird to think about studying something else after so much time working with computers. This is what I do, it's safe, it's there, I know how to do it.

Part of my problem is that so many books teach by analogy.  It's all well and good that you should think of an object, say a car, and the methods and data that would go into it.

Why I am hesitant to judge another's code...,"So I am a bit lucky in that my father is a very experienced programmer who also gave me the bug.  One of the first things he said to me when I started programming for more than just fun or OSS, was that he never judged other programmers code.  He would correct it, point out flaws in it, but always with a suggestion of how to do it better.  The reason for this is that in the world that we have to live in, of deadlines, PHBs and evil marketing folks who spring new features on a development team right before a release, you never know why someone's code is the way it is.  As I have gotten more experienced, and lead teams of my own I have found this to be invaluable.  Occasionaly of course you are going to get someone who just can't code, but more often than not you just won't get anything from them, much less anything working.  Most folks are continually improving in their code quality and understanding as they progress through one project and on to the next, and trashing their code generally does more harm than good.  I used to think I would only write graceful, perfect code that was well commented, easy to read, and as modular as it should be.  Then I got one of those friday night phone calls requesting something be done by monday to close a deal.  Then another.  Then another.  Sure you can push back to a degree, and say that you can't do something right in the time span alloted, but at the end of the day your stuff has to ship.  And it has to ship before the other guy's stuff does.  You can always clean it up later (even if you never do) and more often than not, as has been said many times, by far smarter people than me, ""worse is better"".

"How do I go from OOP to good, procedural C code?","I'm a CS student who does some small programming jobs on the side (at the university, nothing too serious). I know Java quite well and did some projects in C++, too. 

My new job requires me to use C and I keep getting stuck. I know the C syntax, I'm not afraid (or ignorant) of pointers and I have sufficient knowledge of the hardware level. But I'm more familiar with object-oriented languages and patterns, used to having an extensive API with common data structures ...so the code I now produce is ugly, riddled with failed attempts at making interfaces to modules (accessors, not defining structs in header files), different naming patterns and several ways of error handling.

Usually you see people having trouble going from procedural to object-oriented... well, this time it's the other way around. Do you have some useful advice on how to do this (and good C style in general)?

So I'm a noob. The professor wrote half of this. We had to write a few functions that he left blank. The user inputs the amount due and the amount paid. The output is the number of dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies in the change.

Question for Mac/OS X programmers,"I'm not a programmer by any means. The closest I've come to it is basic HTML, CSS, Flash AS2 and a little PHP for my design clients. Keep this in mind.

What difficulties/challenges would be involved in programming a screensaver (Leopard/Snow Leopard compatible) that would pull information from multiple sources and display it graphically? What language is involved in OS X screen-savers?

The reason I ask is I'd like a ""today"" screen on my iMac, similar to what I've seen on some mobile handsets, but far prettier obviously. I'd like to be able to wake up, glance is my screen and auto-magically see the weather, time, how many e-mails and other basic info. Maybe even upcoming iCal appointments. I know that would have to pull from a variety of sources. I'm sure this is over my head but I'm not sure why Apple didn't already make it to begin with. It would be incredibly handy to have all that information at-a-glance. Now that I think about it, Apple should have this on the unlock screen on the iPhone too.

"Proggit: I have a problem with pointers in C , can you help?","I was to write a program for a stepper motor interface.

I decided to use two FSMs, one as a motor driver and one as a button controller. Based on the button input the motor was to go forward, backward or vibrate, but I am having a pointer issue.
The controller's FSM doesn't properly pass the direction variable to the motor's FSM and I'm pretty sure it's solely because I'm getting the level of indirection wrong.

**Here's the offending code:**

    void step(void)
    {

      MOTORPORT = (MOTORPORT &amp; 0xF0) + motorCS -&gt; Out; // output correct sequence to motor's port

      motorCS = motorCS -&gt; Next[controllerCS -&gt; Direction]; //motor's next sequence based on controllerCS's next 'Direction'

    //TODO: this is where the problem occurs. 'controllerCS -&gt; Direction' doesn't get fed into 'motorCS -&gt; Next[index]' as an index.

    // in fact, I don't know what it does at all. I think it just laughs at me for not getting the level of indirection right.
     }

Since *controllerCS -&gt; Direction* is a pointer to an address I think that I am accidentally passing the address to *motorCS -&gt; Next* but I am not sure.


**Here's the motorState FSM:**

    unsigned char BtnInput;   /* holds initial port input from buttons. used to index 'Next' in controllerFSM */

    /* states for the stepper movement */

    const struct motorState
    {
      unsigned char Out;      /* Output to Port H */
      const struct motorState *Next[3];
    };

    typedef const struct motorState motorStateType;
    typedef motorStateType *    motorStatePtr;
    motorStatePtr motorCS;  /* Current motorState */

    #define S5  &amp;FSM[0]
    #define S6  &amp;FSM[1]
    #define S10 &amp;FSM[2]
    #define S9  &amp;FSM[3]

    motorStateType FSM[4] = 
    {
      {0x05,{S6,S9,S5}},
      {0x06,{S10,S5,S6}},
      {0x0A,{S9,S6,S10}},
      {0x09,{S5,S10,S9}}
    };

**Here's the controllerState FSM:**

    const struct controllerState
    {
      unsigned char Direction;            // Output to Port T
      unsigned short Time;          // Time in msec to wait in this state
      const struct controllerState *Next[16];  // Next state if input=0,1,2,3
    };

    typedef const struct controllerState ctrlStateType;
    typedef ctrlStateType *    ctrlStatePtr;
    ctrlStatePtr controllerCS;  /* Current State */



    ctrlStateType controllerFSM[10] =
    {
    /*0:Rest*/  {direction,time,{nextstates}},
    /*1:Fore*/  {direction,time,{nextstates}},
    /*2:Back*/  {direction,time,{nextstates}}

     };


Please let me know if I should comment some more, I never know how much to write in my comments.

Edit: removed most of the preprocessor directives for readability.

In case you are going to say '*next[]' never gets initialised, it does.

*Next[3] actually works; if I write
    motorCS = motorCS -&gt; Next[0];

for example, the motor steps forward just fine.
The problem is when I try to retrieve the index from the controller's FSM by saying

    motorCS = motorCS -&gt; Next[controllerCS -&gt; Direction];",programming

"Tired of people comparing languages by doing Project Euler problems, suggest alternatives","I'm tired of people comparing languages by doing Project Euler problems.  I mean, it sounds like a great way to learn some of each language's strengths and weaknesses, and it's cute to post performance comparisons.  But it's obvious in these posts that the author is not really that familiar with some of the languages in question, and that these small exercises aren't helping.  The benchmarking is downright silly.

I think if you want to learn a language, try writing a nontrivial program in that language.  Write a web application in Haskell (the language is more suited for it than you'd think).  Write an adventure game in Prolog (again, the language is good at that).  Write a web scraper in Python (okay, maybe that's too easy).  Do something someone else hasn't already solved for you.  Not that you shouldn't do Euler problems, but what's the fun of never doing something nobody's done?  I would love to see more suggestions below.

Should I start my project over using a web framework?,"I created a comic book (.cbr/.cbz) reader using php, mysql and apache.  (I put the code on Sourceforge as a lark:  ).

Which job to take out of college.,"Hey everyone,

I am a senior at a pretty big university and getting close to graduation, as it stands now I have two offers for full time employment. The first being at a big company doing client application development (Java, J2ee, SAP, etc) the other is working for the university (I currently work as a student developer and am being offered to stay on full time) doing .NET web development (ASP.NET, Silverlight, MVC, etc)

Here are some pros/cons for each company that I can think of:


Big company:

pros: advancement, great training programs, structured application development, adds more diverse experience to my background

cons: less pay, no continued education



college job:

pros: what I've been doing for the past year, laid back environment, higher pay, free higher education

cons: less structured, development can get messy between people (no coding standards etc), stuck at same level until i move on or retire, and about the same pay



I love my current job because it is very laid back, the people are great, and i enjoy working with .Net. At the moment I am leaning towards the big company because I want to be able to advance and become a project manager or lead developer at some point and also because I want the professional development experience of working with coding standards and all that jazz.

What I would like to know from you guys is what your experience has been like working with a large software developer and if you've enjoyed it or just simply what advice you could give and what your thoughts are on my situation.

Thanks!

[Ask] Authentication solution for REST?,"I'm building a web-based application and I want it to be mostly AJAX talking to a remote REST service. There will be a user registration/login facility and many responses from the server will, naturally, depend on the login status.

What is the simplest solution for this? Ideally, I want my REST service to be easily debuggable from a browser without any additional tools. Is it cookies? Some session tokens? If so, are they passed in the URL (porbably a bad idea) or in HTTP headers?

Any real-world examples, maybe, of how some of the popular web sites do authentication with REST?


**Update**: Thank you for your answers. So the consensus so far is:

* Basic HTTP Auth: least secure, need SSL. Pros include: you can debug stuff by providing user/password in the URL (e.g.  You can prevent the browser from displaying the ""ugly"" dialog by simply not sending 401, but instead you send some other response code to let your client know the resource requires authentication. Your AJAX client will figure what to do.

* Digest HTTP Auth: supported by major browsers, more secure, OK without SSL in principle. However, in this case 401 should be sent to let the browser know about the particular auth method in use.

* Custom auth methods are in the end just non-standard variations of the Digest HTTP Auth, except you are free to decide where and how to send auth data (headers, request/response body, URL). Debugging with a ""naked"" browser is problematic if possible at all.

* Cookies are basically OK. There is an opinion ""cookies are not RESTful"", although I still don't understand why.
Drawbacks: a bit problematic if you are going make REST calls from an application rather than from a browser. The application will have to handle HTTP cookies the way browsers do.

I forgot to mention (and I'm sorry about that) that one of the requirements is the ability to use the REST service from 3rd party applications.

**UpdUpdate**: the reason for various ""ideological"" limitations in REST, including cookies, is caching, load balancing and scalability. With some caution cookie-based service can be scaled, though it's not trivial.

All in all, the best solutions involve somewhat costly hash calculations on both sides. What's achieved in return is good separation of the data layer allowing access from both browsers and apps and at the same time maintaing user authentication with some reasonable level of security.",programming

Why are password lockout thresholds so low?,"At work, a lead engineer made this point:

* The point of a password lockout is to prevent password guessing by an attacker.

* Every time a password lockout forces the legitimate user to perform a password reset, the password lockout has failed (remember, its goal was to stop bad guys, never good guys). The system has just performed a DoS on itself. This can be easily used by attackers to intentionally DoS your system by randomly guessing passwords, and so a too-low lockout is a security vulnerability, not a strength. Also, password resets are themselves a security hole in any system. The more common they are, the easier it is to exploit the reset process itself.

* The correct way to pick the number of tries before lockout is pick a number that is above the number of times a legitimate user will guess before performing a password reset, but below the number of guesses an attacker needs to guess before having a statistically significant chance of actually guessing the correct password.

There are lots of ways to work out that number. It depends on how complicated your passwords are required to be, and how random they actually are. But let's take a simple case with very conservative numbers:

* 7 letters, lower-case only, no numbers, no symbols
* Total space = 26^7 ~ 8 billion
* Expected guesses in order to have a 1 in a million chance ~ 8000

No legitimate user is going to come anywhere near 8000 tries before giving up, so even with all the safety margins above (a very small password universe and a 1:1M chance of guessing), the limiting factor is the user, not the safety margin.

My usual recommendation is around 25-100 for this setting (assuming some minimum ""strong password"" requirements). Anything below 10 definitely hurts security more than it helps.

If you set it over 50 or so, then a password lockout should be highly suspicious, and should notify admins to investigate. This many attempts means someone is trying to brute force your passwords, or there is a program that is repeatedly trying to login and needs to be fixed. You only get this benefit if you set the threshold high enough that there are very few false positives.",programming
"Proggit, please help me understand the Y Combinator","Okay, so here it goes. I been delving into functional programming, and I can't really understand the Y Combinator explanations that have been given to me. So I decided to try and understand it by thinking about it and trying to create my own way to get anonymous recursive functions.

So here is what I have ( and hopefully not *too* far away from the Y Combinator):

you have a function f(x) that you want to make recursive, for this example, i'll use the classic factorial function.

So factorial is defined as:

    fact(n):
        if(n=1 or n=0)
           return 1
        else
           return n*fact(n-1)

Since we do not have named functions, we'd get:
       f(x):
        if(x=1 or x=0)
           return 1
        else
           return n*??(n-1)

Now, I thought of creating another function, which takes the function we want to make recursive like so (x=higher order function, n=factorial to compute):
       f(n,x):
         x(n,x)

Now the x function can call itself, since you passed the same function as an argument. 

 So all we would have to do is call f with x being the anonymous factorial function we want to make recursive, along with an extra argument. So this is what my final factorial would look like:

    lambda(n,x):
       if n&lt;2
           return 1
        else 
            return n*x(n-1)


Now all I have to do is call f with the anonymous function I just created ( f could be an anonymous function itself), and voila, we have a recursive function.

However, this is as far as I've gotten, the Y combinator does some extra steps, and it ends up with functions with only one argument, that I can not understand....


Please help me derive the Y Combinator from what i've got until now ( or  if I'm totally off, correct me)

Thanks Proggit!",programming

jQuery function question - calling function from a $.post call,"Hi, I'm new to jQuery and am struggling with calling functions from different pages. Here's an example:

I have a main.jsfile  which is loaded in the footer of the page which includes a simple onclick function:

    $('.myDiv').click(function() {
      doSomething();
    });

    function doSomething() {
      // do something
    }

On the page that calls this file I have:

    &lt;div class=""myDiv""&gt;Do something&lt;/div&gt;

This works with no problems. Now if I use $.post to load another file into a div on the original page and the new file also wants to call doSomething it does nothing.

If I call the function using the old school method:

    &lt;div class=""myDiv"" onclick=""doSomething()""&gt;Also do something&lt;/div&gt;

So...what am I doing wrong - how do I make page2, called in by page1 see the function in main.js which is loaded by page1? I don't want to resort to scattering onclick functions throughout the code.

Ask Reddit: How big to agile projects get? What're the largest?,"A few months back Tim Bray mused that agile teams have been eating enterprise teams for lunch. They seem to deliver more quickly and fail less often.

But how much is this merely a function of project size? Decades of ""old school"" software engineering has mapped out the fact that project size -- in features, requirements, function points, SLOCs, $ budget, you name it -- is the single most predictive factor for project success or failure.

So could it be that agile projects succeed not due to the processes, but because they seem to focus on small projects?

This is a falsifiable hypothesis, I think. The trick is to find large agile projects for comparison with industry metrics on more conventional projects. Are the largest agile projects in the tens of thousands of SLOCs? 100,000s? Millions?

I understand the C++ language but I don't know how to write software,"I myself know the C++ language and it's features, its inheritance, polymorphism, templates, dynamic memory. I've read well regarded books like C++ Primer but I don't know how to construct software. That is I ""can not"" write substantial aplications.

Currently my projects are simple 32 bit console applications, recently I wrote a simple String class. But I don't know how to write large projects or use API's.

I hate this limitation, so I ask the community if they could recomend a friendly API or SDK or book that doesn't teach the C++ language but teaches you how to use the C++ language for creating applications with substance or with some real world importance.


EDIT: If you want to recomend another language that would be helpful aswell, I was thinking possibly trying out RUBY and learning web development, but ultimately whatever language you recomend I want to create useful applications.",programming
Proggit: Why Do People Hate Java?,"from where i'm sitting, Java seems to be falling out of favor in the programming community. indeed, most people seem to be developing a strong negative attitude to the language, the intensity of which surprises me. why is this?

is it the language itself? personally, i like Java, and i find that it lets me write good software quickly and easily. what do you guys think? do the missing features -- for example, first-class functions and lambdas -- get in your way? do you just hate explicit typing, or static typing in general?

or is it the jobs available with Java? most Java jobs involve working in a soul-sucking corporate environment, with other programmers who don't know what they're doing, for an ""architect"" who's pedantic and overpaid.

either (or another!) answer is valid, but i'm interested to know why Java seems to be falling out of vogue. if it's the language, that's fair, but i want to understand why; if it's the environment, that sucks, but it doesn't seem fair to condemn a whole language because of the way it's used.",programming
Looking for a simple means (read: language/environment/libraries) of manipulating and animating a lot of pixels without lag.,"I've played with moving pixels around for things like particle demos and animated, interactive image manipulation toys, but the languages in which I've done this aren't very low level and are quite slow. I'm not a *real* programmer, though I've dabbled here and there in a dozen or so languages (perl, python, c++, javascript, actionscript, various flavors of basic, even toyed in assembly). My math-fu is sadly weak, so anything that automatically handles e.g. 3D camera movements would also be nice.

I feel like I need to harness the graphics card directly to go any further, as things I create these days might need to push around millions of pixels interactively, and I get &lt;1FPS. Is there anything fairly simple out there that really screams through pixel transforms, but is accessible to a non-guru? I'm on Linux, if it matters. I kind of wish I could just get Processing to work through OpenGL, as it's easy enough to write something quickly in there without needing to be a CS major. Thanks.",programming

Artistic schools devote much time to studying existing masterpieces of art. Why don't programming colleges do the same?,"Why isn't there a programming discipline named like ""The design of great programs""? Or is there? 

I think such a course is almost vital: imagine composers, artists or architects studying their craft by only reading books and doing exercises, as programmers do.

It also seems like demand for such a discipline definitely exists: people (at least at reddit) often ask ""where can I read some great code""; there appear popular books like ""Beautiful code"" and ""Programming pearls"".

Warning: If you find an exploit in a popular web-based strategy game and share the details expect to hear about it for months after it has been patched.,"I don't know how many of you are familiar with the game Empire Craft.  Basically a web-based grind game where you try to build the biggest empire, join guilds and take out other empires.  I played back when there wasn't really much to the game but it was enough to get me logging in once or twice a day.

One day I was playing around with firebug in their arena store (you exchange points from winning battles in the arena for items and equipment).  I ended up finding the buy function which took two int parameters.  I looked up the full definition in their script file and it was as follows: buy(itemId, cost).  With some more digging I grabbed the ajax call that bypassed some checks, a prompt and just gave me the item I requested.

After a couple hours I had a set of max level characters and one of every item in the game (including ones they charge absurd amounts for as a part of their e-commerce shenanigans).  This ruined the game for me since there was no drive to see what the end-game was like after I rolled over it in an evening.

The next day I had a couple emails from their gm team saying ""There has been a glitch in our software and it accidentally awarded you several level 70 characters.  If you delete them we'll give you several epic hereos, equipment and resources.""  I let them know that it wasn't a bug but rather a hack and that I'd gladly explain the details and they can simply delete the account.

Long story short... they didn't delete the account, I haven't played much since but I am still getting emails from other players with ""How did you do this?????  Can u show me. etc...""  Today I got a message on reddit from someone who created an account just to ask how to hack the game.

tldr; I hacked Empire Craft Sept 09 and am still getting emails from players asking how to hack the game.

Here are some pics:

Anyone run into this c++ problem?,"I have a class called GenomeSeq that has a massive string called sequence.
Then I have a class that is called GeneSeqs that has a bunch of objects called Seq that are comprised of char pointers to a specific character within the string I discussed earlier - sequence.

I checked the main string, sequence, and it is absolutely fine! Infact all the other Seq objects work just fine. Only the ones that points to character indexed at 0 have this weird problem....

Cut to a few weeks ago I was busy deleting spam (Gmail's spam filter still misses a surprising amount), and I noticed that some of them were sent to that email address I had only ever used once.

Copy the code above into your address bar or make a bookmark of it. You can run it on a user page to see that user's comments, or run it on any reddit page and it'll prompt you for a user. The dots on the grid are **clickable**, they'll open another tab with the actual comment you click. Don't worry about clicking exactly on the dot though; it just chooses the closest one to wherever you click. It also only shows the last 1000 comments, since that's as far back as reddit lets you list.

I've tested it in Firefox 3.5 and Chrome.

The bookmarklet uses the reddit api and an HTML5 canvas. It you want to see a prettier version of the code, paste it in here and check it out. If you have any questions, comments, or suggestions for improvement, please let me know. Enjoy!

It works exclusively with reddit's RSS feeds, which sort of hinders it's capabilities. For instance, it doesn't have access to votes or anything like that. Also, comments don't get nested (although they are in the correct order, so they are readable).

Are there any artificial intelligence projects aiming to replace web developers?,"Using the term 'web developer' here in a loose sense, not to offend anyone, but see the examples below for what I mean by that.

E.G., user logs in to this web site, types in:

I am a plumbing/biosciences/creative/xxx company.  I need a new website.

System asks a series of questions, presents choices including templates, possibly tries to interpret specific requests about layout or features, uses stock photo libraries, templates, user input etc. to build a web site.

Once the site has been built out, the same system allows the business owner to input requests for periodic updates.  For example:  'Please add the following photos to the gallery.'  Or, 'please change the text on the home page to xxxx.'   Or, 'I need a new design that looks more like website xxxx'.  Or 'add the following data item to the catalog'.  Etc.

It seems to me that quite a few emails are going in to web developers or people maintaining and building web sites (like me) that are common enough that some type of newer statistical text analysis or something might actually be able to figure out a lot of requests and handle them without involving an actual person.  It seems that there are quite a few people that would rather pay for an outsourced Indian or something to maintain their site rather than learn Joomla and spend fifteen or twenty minutes logging in and updating their photos or whatever. 

I think a lot of the types of emails generated by those people could actually be handled by an AI that would do the updates for them (although it would need to be an interactive system and so emails probably aren't the best way to do that).",programming
Clojure - A passable Lisp?,"Hi all,

After reading the article The Nature of Lisp I've finally decided to give Lisp a try. Given that I'm a typical Java programmer, Clojure seemed to be a nice choice. But is Clojure a passable Lisp? Do Clojure programmers feel that they have achieved *teh* nirvana after getting down and dirty with Clojure? Does being tied to the JVM make Clojure an ""almost Lisp"" implementation? Would I be better off with some other Lisp implementation as a beginner?

Suggestions much appreciated. TIA!",programming

Do you think we'll ever simplify human language rules to facilitate Natural Language Processing?,"I understand the argument that modifying our language greatly limits our expressive powers, but certainly there are some practices which do nothing but add ambiguity.  

For instance, both words at the beginning of a sentence and proper nouns are capitalized.  This means that sometimes the only way to distinguish between a normal noun and a proper one at the beginning of a sentence is context.  Example: ""Bills are generally disliked"" could refer to people named Bill or one of the many meanings for the noun ""bill"".

I know that this is a flimsy example at best, and that even if we completely changed humans' habits, Natural Language Processing would be terribly hard.  I was just wondering whether you thought this might naturally happen over time, and if you can think of any other examples of frustrating language constructs.",programming

In this economy, I'm happy to find anything.. but when potential employers ask me what kind of salary I'm looking for, I'm terrified of shooting too low (and getting paid less than I'm worth) or too high (and pricing myself out of the job).  

Does anyone have any resources for figuring out what I should be earning?

Anyone care to share neat critical thinking skills?,"It has been very hard for me to find other computer programmers that are able to think critically and rationally about this: the insistence upon textual representations is what is holding back software development.

Here is part of a recent discussion.  I am generally getting all kinds of arguments that are very unconvincing.  As far as I can tell, the objections are rooted in cognitive bias rather than logic.

Textual programming languages are what is holding back software development.  Please see some of my previous comments/submissions if you are interested in that train of thought, but basically for starters all types of two dimensional graphical and interactive notations should be available for programming in collaborative real-time environments.  so, for example, to start with, if instead of writing 1 / (n+2), I wanted to write (or input, which might involve some special syntax, keyboard shortcuts/contextual autocomplete, or even (gasp) mouse operation(s))

1
___

n+2

or something like that (actually it interpreted my three underscores in markdown as an hr, that's not what I wanted, but whatever), it shouldn't be a such a big deal for a programming language to handle.  I think the reason this is very hard and people have brain-washed themselves into thinking its not even desirable, is because people assume that programming languages need to be entirely parsed text.  That was the case when programming languages were originally invented, because they did not have graphical interactive displays back in those days.  That is not the case today.

Graphical and interactive two dimensional notations and we shouldn't be limited to text.

Just take the specific example I gave.  Would it not be useful to be able to use that type of mathematical notation inside of computer programs that contained mathematical formulas?

&gt;Shifting to textual languages from pictorial ones was an inflection point in the growth of human knowledge

Again, I wasn't talking about pictorial languages, but anyway, have we really shifted entirely to textual languages in the way that computer programming languages are textual?  Does an architect use textual languages?  Do  mechanical/electrical/civil engineers use textual languages to design and develop their systems?  Do business analysts use textual languages to develop and document their processes?  Do mathematicians use textual languages to do their work? Does a software engineer design and document a large software system or framework with many different classes involving teams of developers in Notepad?  Are those professionals solving complex problems?

When we stopped drawing general pictures and moved towards more abstract glyphs etc. that had established meanings, that was an improvement, but the reason that our language is a series of glyphs/letters/words is because it is meant to be spoken, and we can only make one sound at a time, so we make a series of them in order to represent more information.  That is the reason we ended up with alphabets/words/paragraphs etc., not because linear streams of symbols are ideal.  Its because we are talking monkeys.

&gt; shifting from 1Dish to 2Dish languages isn't going to make a big deal of difference to problems that are often very multidimensional

Yes, problems are often very multidimensional.  Relying on textual languages that are more or less single dimensional and have to be decompressed and expanded into structures by our minds makes it harder to solve  and understand problems.

Analysts that do multidimensional analysis on product data for example using OLAP tools that have two or sometimes three dimensional views would disagree with you if you suggested that they should be limited to textual reports (in paragraph form, really is what you are suggesting, since programming languages don't even have built-in facilities for tables).",programming
"I want to move beyond just following along with ""tutorials"" and beginner books, but I'm not sure how!","I'm taking a Java programming course this spring as a programming language elective for my Computer Science degree. Class hasn't started yet, but the syllabus is online and it seems to be a bit different than any other class I've ever taken. There are no assignments, just a midterm and final project. 

The midterm project is typical (create an ATM ""simulation"", which utilizes a MySQL database), but we get to select our own final project. The requirements are that it is has to be written in Java, has to be at least as complex as the midterm project, and has to be an individual project (no groups). I've been thinking about what type of application to create, and I'm actually pretty excited to get started. I don't even know Java yet (my previous classes have all used C++), but I'm very comfortable with C++, and I'm not worried about Java at all.

So, like I said, I've been thinking about what project to do, but I'm realizing now I've never really written anything more complicated than the examples/exercises in my text books, tutorials online, etc. One of the ideas I've had for my project is a simple BitTorrent client, but I'm finding that I don't really know where to begin on something like that. I did find the BitTorrent specifications online, but its only a specification and not a ""tutorial"" so I'm not really sure how to use the spec to actually create the client! I'm willing to put in the work for this project (or something similar/similarly difficult), but I don't really know how to begin.

Does anyone have any advice wisdom to share with me? I think (hope) that once I get past this first ""big"" project I won't be so lost on the next one.

Ask Proggit: A script to send a growl notification when you get an orangered,"Hey proggit,

I found a post describing how to get a growl notification when you get a new orangered. Not only is this awesome, and it needs some more recognition on its own, but I have been trying to do a little tinkering with it.

Since it simply checks to see if you have a new message every 5 minutes, and then tells you, it has the possibility of telling you constantly, every five minutes. What I've been trying to do, is get it to tell you once, then shut up. Then, when it notices the orangered is no longer orangered (it's gray), it goes back to the state of waiting for a new message.

Best Linux/UNIX way to step through and debug C program?,"Dammit, Jim, I'm a sysadmin not a programmer!  

So I've been tasked with debugging this abandoned C program on a server I admin.  The last time I did any major screwing around in C, Borland's Turbo C/C++ IDE was fresh and kicked ass.  Not only am I woefully rusty in my C, but I'm clueless as to getting a UNIX enviroment/IDE that comes close to the Tubo C IDE I so fondly remember.

I need a way to trace and debug this puppy ASAP.  I don't care if it's console mode (any good emacs tutorials out there for this?) or a huge bloated GUI will all the bells and whistles (does Eclipse have these kinds of features?).

Any and all pointers would be appreciated.

EDIT: Yes, I have the source file.  The platform is FreeBSD 8.0.  It's nothing so complicated as a memory leak or anything obscure.  It's just a relatively simple program which has begun puking since the the rollover to 2010.  The author(s) are long since gone.  If I was an experienced C coder, I'd be able to fix this in my sleep.  As I'm just an admin with *light* experience in C (CS101 twenty years ago), I need a visual crutch to help me track down and try to fix the bug.

Thus far, ""kdbg"" has been the most immediately helpful, as I can easily step along the code and watch all the variables as they change.  Eclipse had problems and Netbeans is very slick, though both are sluggish and absolute beasts in terms of system resources (relatively speaking, anyway).  What I should be doing is re-learning to code in C while learning one of these two nicer IDEs.  Maybe when I have the time.

FINAL EDIT:  I've solved the problem.  See here for my response to a post about the nature of the problem.  In the end, I used emacs/gdb and kdbg, the latter being the most useful, while I'm determined to get more versed with the former for future debugging sessions.

I openly admit I f'ed up on this project. There are so many things that I learned in managing this project. While I slaved away on updates to the iPhone app, I only tested on simulators and not real hardware. I was busy, and didn't do the job that I should have been doing of thoroughly testing the app on real hardware. There were many other ways that I failed on this project, and because of that I got in this situation.

Unfortunately now that I'm in the position and I haven't invented a time machine, I can't do anything except for reach out for help. We finally got a RIM employee to say, ""Tomorrow"" to us, so we're now waiting until tomorrow and seeing what happens. If we don't, it sounds like we might have a couple of people who have contacts at RIM that might be able to get us a more straight answer or help push some buttons.

I appreciate all of you who have offered advice and help. Hopefully tomorrow this own't be an issue anymore.

** Original Post **

We have had a heck of a time on this project, and it needs to be released for a time-sensitive reason by Wednesday, but the contractor didn't make us aware that we needed signing keys until last week. We immediately registered to get them, but RIM is silent and we're running out of time.

If anyone has any keys that we could use, I would be happy to go into more details about the project so that you can rest assured that we won't be abusing them. We will really only use them for this one build, and as soon as we get our own keys, we will cease use.

If you can be of help or know of anyone that can be of help, pm me here or email me jon @ myusername .com

"Proggit, please help me choose languages for my book on game programming!","I'm working with O'Reilly]( on a book of design patterns for game programming: [Game Programming Patterns. That and the chapter listing should give you a rough idea of what it'll be. While it's mainly about software architecture, my goal is to give advice that's easily applicable to real game codebases, not ivory tower platitudes.

I have two target readers in mind: working game programmers who want to make their game codebases more maintainable and aspiring amateur game programmers who are having trouble putting the pieces of their game together in a way that works.

Here's where you come in. Right now, the example code is in C++. I chose that because that's *the* language of big professional games. Most hardcore game programming is in C++, and I want to make sure the patterns work there.

However, lots of games are being written in other languages these days: ActionScript, Lua, Obj-C, etc. O'Reilly asked me to consider including sample code in other languages. They had some advice on which ones, but they aren't experts on the game industry.

So, if you could help me out, it will just take a click of your time. Please upvote the comment(s) below that apply to you. If I missed a language, feel free to add it. Other comments or questions are totally welcome. Thanks!

(Note: as a way of saying thanks to all of the feedback I've gotten so far, my goal is to have the entire text of the book online for free.)

Ideas for intentionally obfuscating computer science course titles?,"A new CS course entitled ""... web development ..."", ""... applied networking ..."", etc. is likely to get high enrollment at most universities because students typically complain that they want real-world skills to get a job instead of foundations, blah, blah, blah...  but they aren't going to a trade school.

Say you had the option to set the title for a course on programming web applications, but wanted to have a small enrollment (changing the cap is not an option).  What would you call the course to scare off all but the most dedicated students? Some cooked-up options are: ""Event driven asynchronous client/server systems"" or ""foundations of  software development for networked systems"" ...  

Profs tend to play these games all the time -- their pay is not based on enrollment.  But, teaching a class is a good way to learn the material and get some free labor (however, having too many undedicated students takes up their time).  Hence, the trickery.",programming

* natural capacity of the person for the task

* people are going to get sick or go on vacation

* people are going to have personal problems that affect them

* we need time to test the project as well after the people think they are finished

* the people will have to talk and discuss problems together creating unforeseen overhead

Why doesn't a type inference based non-functional language exist?,"Hi Guys,
I was wondering as to Why doesn't a type inference based non-functional language exist?

What I mean by this is: Consider a language which has static typing + type inference. Wouldn't that make it much easier and have higher clarity? This way we can use type declaration when required and not use it when it serves better purpose.

Example: You are developing a project (Only applicable for Hobby Projects, I guess) and you have vague idea of what a particular variable might hold. You know what is to be stored in it but haven't yet decided on which container to use. If you decide to use one and go thru creating all the classes and methods and such, and at a latter point decide to use a different container (like in Java, Array vs ArrayList) then your code immediately breaks and you have go about renaming the declaration used.

Also, consider your code using trivial variables which you will use and throw away after some obvious use, in such cases, wouldn't having type inference make sense?

Ofc, having Static Typing has its advantage of helping to understand code easily (setting aside Performance bonus.) as compared to dynamic languages which allow no type declaration for function return values. 

Wouldn't it be better to have both features mixed? 

( I generally use Python &amp; Java and just touched Haskell. I originally thought Dynamic Languages worked along the principles of Type Inference and that is still how I program it. )

Here is my simple program simulating a poker betting strategy. Would this strategy work in theory?,"I've been thinking about this No-Limit Hold'Em Cash Game strategy for a while .The idea is that every somewhat decent hand, I will go all-in. For the first hand I will bring in, say, a dollar. If I lose, I take whatever I just lost in total, and add one more dollar. So I lost one, I would then come in with two dollars. If I lost again, I would come in with four dollars (1 + 2 + 1). If I lost again, I would come back in with eight dollars (1 + 2 + 4 + 1). And so on. The theory is that over the long run, given a large enough bankroll to handle any unlucky runs, that the strategy would win money.

Here is my java program to simulate it (running in main):

Random rand = new Random();
		int bankroll = 100;  //money on hand total
		int random, bet = 1;
		
		for(int j=0;j&lt;10;j++){
			bet = 1;
			bankroll = 100;
		for(int i=0;i&lt;10000;i++){
			random = rand.nextInt(10); //a low estimate of a ten percent chance of taking the pot each hand
			if(random==0){
				bankroll = bankroll + bet;
				bet = 1;
			}
			else{ 
				bankroll = bankroll - bet;
				bet = bet + (bet + 1);
			}
		}
		System.out.println(bankroll);
		}
	}

My results say that there is an average of one dollar gained for every hand played with a small chance of busting out and going broke. Somehow something seems wrong. Can someone here with more programming/probability/statistics knowledge than me feed me some information on this subject? Thanks.",programming

Advice please - database or programming?,"Hey Redditors, love you, love your show!  

A little background - currently doing one of the six month programs to get MCPD cert.  I have no prior programming experience but am pretty comfortable with computers otherwise.  I am finding this whole experience to be the hardest thing I've ever done.  I went to nursing school and maintained a 4.0 so I don't think I'm stupid but damn if Microsoft isn't beating me down.  

We've spent several weeks going over .NET with C# and, although I'm okay with the concepts such as inheritance and encapsulation and whatnot, I am frustrated that I am still unable to just flip on the computer and write something.  Anything.  The MS manuals we are using are horrible IMHO and I feel like I have no grasp of when to do things, why they are done at that point and what you would use it for in real life.  The teachers keep saying that we will get better as we do things but I feel as if I've been given a hammer and nails that I've never seen before and told to go play and become a master carpenter.  Does this make sense?  

My exposure to databases is small and is pretty much just SQL but it seems (again, from my limited view) that database work is more structured/organized.  More rule based, maybe?  Would y'all agree?  I think part of what I am having trouble with in C# is the many different ways to do things and all of the shortcuts that exist.  I tend to do best when I know what you are supposed to do and why you are supposed to do it.  I find myself asking questions in class to this end and, more often than not, the answer is ""just 'cause, don't know why, just how it's always been done"".  So would you say that working with databases would be more along my sort of thinking?  Or am I totally off base and just ignorant of how much I don't know yet?

At this point I can still switch and go on to the SQL track.  What say you, o' masters of Reddit programming?  Keep chugging along or cut my losses and change it up?  If I stay with apps development will I have a moment of clarity when it all gels in my head and starts flowing out my fingers?

LoudTap falls into the latter category - there is no online/offline state, and it acts in most ways identical to the native messaging app.  And no, we did not integrate with SMS, so you can only interact with people on an iPhone.

Can anyone tell me why you would prefer to instantiate a new object in c++ without using the 'new' keyword ?  Or is down to the function of the object ?

"hey reddit, i made a proof of concept actionscript parser and emulator in javascript.  it emulates flash by processing the original *.as files in js."," - i only tested on chrome for the time being

my proof of concept gets me wondering if eventually one could replace flash/actionscript altogether. what it does in a nutshell is:

* reads an xml configuration file (similar to a .fla file) which has a list of assets
* does an ajax request for each class to an actionscript file (*.as)
* uses parsing logic (mostly borrowed from processing.js) to convert the actionscript into javascript
* calls an initialize method on a custom _root.as file which does what flash would do (adds all movies to scene, runs scene)

i've implemented some of the actionscript core already including:

* the majority of drawing a scene: coordinates, rotations, alpha, etc.
* dynamic addition/removal of movies
* basic hit testing
* almost got sound to work

ideally, the majority of the actionscript 2.0/3.0 core could be implemented, allowing existing flash applications to run in canvas, and eventually reducing the need for flash altogether once an IDE is made.

Anyone else miss the excitement of buying the disk set for a programming language and having it come with many volumes of paper documentation?,"This thread is probably not going to resonate with the youngsters who have only known the Internet.  In 1986, my dad bought me Turbo Pascal for my vanilla IBM PC.  The disk came on one 5.25in floppy disk, and it had an awesome manual that I wore out and had to tape up when the spine finally gave out (and it's still at my parents' house!).  A year or so later, I bought the Microsoft Assembler disks, and it had an even bigger manual, in a thick, hard binder.

The most exciting purchase, though, was when I was on a ship in the Navy circa 1997.  I hadn't done much programming since college, and my Navy job had me running an office full of really sharp sailors, which left me some free time.  I wanted to try to write a few programs related to ship navigation (a moboard.  I snapped it up and lugged it back to the ship.  Opening it up and seeing the mounds of manuals was awesome, as I knew that those manuals were all I had to go on while we were out at sea.

I know it's so much easier to Google for answers these days, and online resources dwarf any hardcopy manual.  But it's not quite the same.

(p.s. The moboard program turned out *great* and all the officers on the ship loved it.  This was before there were any computers on the bridge of Navy ships (although the OPS guys did have the large radar screens back in OPS).  The XO didn't like it so much, as he still wanted everyone doing the hand-calculations on the paper moboard.  I wish I still had that program, just for old time's sake.

My 2 cents on a road map for the end of Adobe Flash,"Today is a good day to begin thinking of a road map to end Adobe Flash's grasp on the internet.  JavaScript isn't good at a lot of things yet, so I'm mostly focusing on Flash games, ads, graphs, etc. as opposed to video and webcam usage.

Today, Gordon: An open source Flash runtime written in pure JavaScript]( was released, and the [comment I agree with most was:

&gt; Even if this project were expanded to a more complete implementation, it is going to be slow as hell. There is no way this is going to be practical for most real applications of flash (e.g. interactive sites, streaming media) any time soon, even with the fastest javascript runtimes out there.

Javascript is getting better, but having it do the same thing as a native flash binary does not get us closer to the end goal.  People would still be using the Flash IDE to create swfs, and at that point, why not just run them with the Flash interpreter?

After pondering about emulating flash in JavaScript, at any level between ActionScript and swf, I have come to the conclusion that Flash dominates the market because while there are various tools on the web for creating graphics and animations in html/javascript, most, if not all, require you to write code *for everything*.  What the Flash IDE does is write the majority of the code for you, leaving you to only fill in certain logic using simple ActionScript and their extensive framework.  This is good for all the non programmers out there.  If we had an IDE, that was similar to the Flash IDE, but instead spit out images and javascript, which when coupled with a js graphics/animation framework would produce the same results as flash, then I think Adobe would start getting scared.  **The day they will lose market share is the day when I can animate a couple circles in an IDE without writing processing.js/svg code and easily deploy it to my website.**",programming

As mentioned above, I'm taking a 8 modular credit (equivalent to 2 full modules) on a module named Software Engineering Project in which we use this time to work on a full fledge open source software in a group.

I enrolled into this module with an optimistic outlook. Initially, I wanted to use this time to work on a startup (webapp) and score grades with it. I checked with the Prof after and was turned down. Perhaps due to module restrictions which I don't quite get because it essentially is still software engineering, but I let that slip, and decided, meh, I'd make full use of that project scope for the module and create something stellar, something the reddit community can use!

Right now, I'm at the lecture, and an hour ago, the Prof mentioned we'd be working on a file sync application. The first thing that came to my mind is, don't we have Dropbox, GIT, SVN, etc for that? But I decided I could come up with sth awesome nonetheless because the above solutions couldn't sync **easily** application configurations across computers, and some other features I believe I could come up with.

So I was really hyped and looking forward to forming a team, and working on what might solve a problem of my own and the multi Linux PCs I have.

Then I looked at the requirement, C# only. IDE: Visual Studio only. And I immediatley went wtf. Cross platform support is meh for C#, and I have to use Windows now to develop? Come on!

I walked and checked with the prof if we could work around the language restriction and then I found out they had received donations from m$ and we have to use C# only! I don't mean to sound like a language narc, in fact, I love learning new languages. The thing is, right now I want to create a tool that would work seamlessly with cross platform issue out of the way, and instead, I have to work with a language that is not really known for its cross platform capabilities.

Perhaps, Proggit, you could help me with this:

1) How can I overthrow this language decision by my college that arised most likely from the very fact that they whored themselves out to m$

2) Tips/Advices on developing cross platform apps on C#/Mono , equivalent IDEs for C# on linux, etc.

What is the correct way to calculate the contrast between two colours?,"Here's the problem I'm trying to solve: Given an RGB triplet and an assumption that we're talking about the sRGB colour space, how can I calculate a shade of that colour that appears to be as dark compared to the original colour as, say, 90% white looks compared to 100% white? I don't need to solve for colours very close to black, so I can assume a minimum apparent brightness. I'm also assuming that if I can calculate the contrast between two colours, I can solve for the second colour using constraints on hue and saturation.

I've tried converting to the HSL colour space, reducing L by a fixed number (or multiplying by a fixed factor), but I end up with inconsistent contrasts. In particular, I can't distinguish between HSL (60°, 100%, 60%) and HSL (60°, 100%, 50%), while HSL (60°, 100%, 50%) and HSL (60°, 100%, 40%) are clear as night and day. For most other hues and saturations, the contrast between 60 and 50 is just fine.

I'm guessing I'm working in the wrong colour space, but I'm fairly naïve about perception of colour. Can anyone point me in the right direction?

**EDIT:** NotAbel]( gave me the answer I was looking for, so here's my Javascript implementation of the colour space conversions for anyone looking to do the same.

To me, C# is money, and if you're not going to show me that you're willing to learn and expand your knowledge in your own time, I don't see why you should be a programmer instead of a Tester.""

Proggit [C# Question]: Generic List of Generics,"Here is an abstraction and simplification of my issue:

I'm not satisfied with the torrent options under Ubuntu, and I've got an interesting idea for a new torrent client that I've wanted to work on for some time, but I just can't seem to figure out how to start on something like that.

Is there a rigorous way to check if two spline curves are coincident?,"I am talking B-Splines here, but any spline will do. Let's say I have two of them, and I want to check if they are coincident, by which I mean that the distance between any point on one curve and the corresponding closest point on the other curve is within a certain tolerance. Is there a procedure that will do that?

I have asked others, and everyone keeps suggesting that I simply check some random sample points on the curves. But this, to me, seems dirty and wrong.

Edit: So far I believe the solution probably should involve breaking the spline curve into its segments. So we can reduce the problem to checking if two polynomial curves in space are coincident. Also it should be possible to use the properties of the polynomials instead of just stupidly checking sample points. 

I am guessing there should be a certain number of minimum and maximum distances between the polynomials (is this equal to the degree of the polynomials like it is for roots?). If that's true, then one would simply have to find these maxima and minima and from that know the overall situation. 

So I guess the problem can be reduced to: given two polynomials in space f(x) and g(y), find the {x,y} pairs where ||f(x) - g(y)||' = 0.",programming

Programming to calculate the distance between two locations (from dynamic input),"Student job search website question:

What is the fastest way to break down two dynamic inputs for location (could be city+state, could be just zip code, could be all 3) and then find a distance between the two in order to return search results that are within X distance?

Such as the location inputs on indeed.com, careerbuilder.com and monster.com?

EDIT1:  Okay so the plan is now to use that free ZIP code database to convert ZIP to lat/long then calculate the distance that way.  My final problem is finding a free/cheap way to convert addresses to ZIP codes which can handle a significant amount of automated queries.  

EDIT2:  I think the choice is now between offering full university/city/state/zip search (whatever they want to enter) and going through Google Maps API or offering ZIP/University name search and doing it locally.  Really not sure which to do, though if googles API isn't lightning I imagine we'll have to do our own lookup.

EDIT3:  Thanks for the awesome advice, we're now using a radius search from a database found on sourceforge (which included city/state/state abbreviation/lat/long).  Cheers everything, really appreciate the community here.",programming

"git, branching, merging and conflict resolution.","So, not quite programming, but the tools programmers use. I'm working on a distributed and branched project where certain branches are ""filtered"" versions of others. So, development goes on in for example ""master"", and then a release gets built and prepared, and then merged into the branch ""cleaned"",  inside the cleaned branch, certain files are removed, others shuffled around and some things are recompressed.
  
Now, I'm trying to get git to stop being sane and attempt to solve the conflicts I get with deleted files in favour of the deletion.   In normal use that's not a problem, ( branch:a has file ""foo/bar""  branch_b deletes it,  you merge again from branch_a and the deletion is kept)  but when the files are rewritten (branch_a:foo/bar is heavily modified)  and you merge, you get a conflict.     The natural and wise thing for an SCM to do is to conflict this out, and let people solve it. Well and fine, git mergetool rocks here.  
  
However, when you approach 12000 files deleted,  it turns to a headache and I want to set a policy ""deleted always has priority in merge""  and can't find a suitable way of doing this -for one branch only-",programming

Crazy idea on how to teach computer programming to 6th graders,"I’ve been asked to teach computer programming to a group of 6th graders. There are two main objectives: 1) introduce the kids to computer programming and related concepts, and 2) get the kids competent enough in a programming language to design and implement a “practical” application. The application is to be entered in an upcoming computer programming contest.

I’ve researched educational programming languages for kids aged 11-13, and I’m not satisfied with what I’m finding (.e.g, squeak, alice, greenfoot). So **my crazy idea is to let the kids invent their own programming language**. They choose the keywords and syntax that make the most sense to them. Of course this would not be a general purpose language. It would be more like a domain specific language for the application they intend to implement. I would implement their language as we go.

Slightly less formal methods in software verification,"The doctoral thesis](~pgut001/pubs/thesis.html) of Peter Gutmann contains a [critique](~peter/04_verif_techniques.pdf) (pdf warning) of the state of the art in formal methods ca 2000.  Additionally, he [describes the technique to verify both the preconditions and postconditions of functions in C.

His technique is particularly interesting to me in that it seems like a nice bridge between current practice and the methods proposed by Ynot and its Hoare Type Theory.

"Reddit, what is the best way for a self-taught programmer to evolve from being pretty good, to becoming a professional?","This question applies to programming in general, not any particular language, although I acknowledge that the path I personally take will probably be language specific in many ways. 

I have been hacking around and coding small web projects for years now. My career focus has been Information Technology, but there was always a need to code things here and there.  Custom reports/data mining, intranet apps, dynamic web sites, one-off business tools, etc.  I have learned a lot over the years, and I am wondering what it would take for me to become a full-time, high quality coder. Obviously going to school would be a good answer, but I don't have time for it with my full time job, second part time job, and family responsibilities. I do have time to learn more about coding during my work day though, especially since my employer is pushing me more and more to make custom apps.

I know there are rules that I do not fully understand ranging from how to correctly case my code (what should be all lower, camel, etc) to more complex ideas and concepts that have to do with correct code architecture and making my own frameworks for apps.  In short, if I wanted to tackle a larger project, I am not confident that I would be able to write it in such a way that it would be considered good, clean, elegant code and not end up being a mess later on as it grows.

The more I ask this question, the more it seems like I should just go out and find the info myself, but I have found that there are so many conflicting philosophies out there online, that I get rather confused and conflicted about which direction to take. Are there any self-made programmers out there that can offer advice for someone like me who is considering taking it to the next level? Are there any helpful books or websites that you would recommend? Any pearls of wisdom?

How do I convince someone with a technical background to co-found a start up with me?,"My mind is business oriented. I created a business plan for a fashion oriented start up company complete with financial (with assumptions) statements.

My question: What do you programmers want to hear? What do you need to know/I need to show you to successfully convince you to take the risk of co-founding a start up?

He sent me the Post Secret books for xmas. He hinted at another present, but said I had to wait. It's a little after Christmas, but I got this email yesterday with the title ""I wanted to make something for you for Christmas"":

""So I told the computer, and it showed me how to write a poem in byte-form.  I can't tell what you're thinking these days, but this will either remind you of something that was good, or send you off.""


It included a link to a poem.zip file, which I downloaded. Inside, there was a file called magicfile with no extension and a ReadMe that said:

""Intructions:

 1: &gt; copy magicfile magicfile.jpg
 2: &gt; copy magicfile magicfile.zip
 ... skip a few ...
 X: Ask it for help""

When I renamed magicfile it turned into a picture of me! (a bad one that he took, but ok) and when I changed magicfile to a .zip inside it contained: Magicfile.exe and a txt called ""Go Ahead"" that said:

""It's safe.  Requires WPF and .Net 3.5 I think...

Whatever, it works on my machine.""

I opened magicfile, and an interface popped up that said ""enter a passphrase"". So, I typed in ""help"" and got this:

""Hi Sara!

As you are just about figuring out, this is just the very beginning of a very, very large rabbit hole you're about to fall into.

You see, sometime in early November, I had an idea for an awesome program.  Simultaneously I was just beginning to think of what might be a decent Christmas present for you.  Put 2 and 2 together, and you get this thing.  I worked on it on and off for a few weeks - it was a pretty fun way to learn WPF and do a lot of interesting byte manipulation.

You see, it's a completely self-contained magical file.  This magical file is three parts:
 1. If you name it .jpg - it's an image!
 2. If you name it .zip - it's a zip file, containing a program
 3. It's a database of many, many more parts that the program reads

Now, when you run the program, it reads the magic file, and asks for a passphrase.

You're obviously gotten that far, or you wouldn't be reading this.  As you can imagine - there are a bunch of passwords.  Not infinite, but many.  I encourage you to guess at words and try to figure them out.  I'll give you the hints that they would be things relevant to you or to us.

With a little ingenuity, you'll be able to figure out a very important passphrase that will take you to the next step...""


As I have gone on and solved some of the mysteries I have found that pictures of me come up, things he's researched, things we did together and so on and so forth. I still am trying to figure out the important passphrase.

I currently design and develop sites, work with Wordpress quite a bit, and have been creating a site using Pligg, an open-source PHP content submission platform. I have a scientific background (chemistry) and have taken and enjoyed a few CS classes. That's just to say that I'm aware of the science behind the work and not just looking to hack things together. 

That said, I'm very interested in moving beyond small scripts, CMS templates, and editing existing frameworks. Given the time, I could probably make something very simple but it would be of dubious security, performance, and scalability. I'm fascinated by the technology and really enjoy just making things work. 

So, what should I do? Should I keep practicing with PHP and learning where I can? Is there an essential book (I have ""Code Complete"" sitting behind me begging for attention) I should read? I'm pretty much a lone wolf right now; should I find collaborators? Is tearing apart another app (i.e. Pligg) a good way to learn (despite how poorly written it is)? What are the essentials to know?

"How to stay motivated with reluctant customer, reluctant boss, bound by NDA, relations?","Story so far:

Big project.
Bad manager, (idiot + PHB) stalled project couple of times for multiple weeks.
Planned opensource, but now seems very distant, looks like promise only for deception.
Client says too busy to define specs in detail. Needs ideas from me. and I have to hound each member to respond. Getting sick.
PHB has great income from other projects, but knows developer is good, so just keeps everything as it is - no help, and no impatience - you see it costs him nothing at all.

My side: 
Might need to move out of town or country soon due to various issues.
Seems increasingly like project will be abandoned due to multiple delays due to unexpected reasons - technical, personal and organisational - PHB, his organisation, superiors, chief X officers etc

Important restriction - cannot ask help from anyone else - 
**Very strong NDA** - ""paid"" or ""to pay"" so do all work alone - **""fight everything""**

Also, cannot walk out of project because many relations will be damaged. 
I am bound by multiple factors and everything has basically stagnated and no help allowed.

"Dear Reddit, how does a mediocre PHP developer go about learning all the right web paradigms without getting lost and/or drowning in them?","Hey Reddit


I've been working as a web developer for about two years now, and lately I've been giving a lot of thought towards the knowledge and skills necessary to build websites capable of handling high traffic while minimizing server stress. I've been particularly disoriented by the sea of web paradigms out there. I am not an advanced web developer by any means. I am pretty familiar with PHP/JS/MySQL development, but that's as far as it goes. For the past few months I've been digging into how (what I consider to be) the most successful sites out there are built. I had a look at Reddit's]( and [Imgur's API's, just to name a couple, and I noticed that I always end up stumbling into a new world of cryptic new technologies, languages, libraries, frameworks, methodologies, etc, that make it impossible to even know where to start learning. Do I choose Ruby? Python? Perl? I even saw references to C language being employed for web use. Why is PHP not good enough?


It seems to me that the difference between developing components or widgets for your Joomla/Drupal/Wordpress website and creating your own customized system using agile development tools is the difference between a website with potential to grow, and one with little or none, unless you're filthy rich. I'm really growing tired of developing on top of bloated, cookie-cutter CMS crap. I can't help but feel that it dumbs me down. It introduces a new layer of user-friendliness that comes at the cost of not being able to optimize it fully.


As far as I've noticed, most websites that expect a lot of traffic, database queries, or concurrent connections end up employing these highly customized arrays of confusingly named technologies. I'm talking about stuff like python, curl/libcurl, json, ruby on rails, cron jobs, just to name a few off the top of my head. I realize these may all be simple and straight-forward concepts to some of you, so I neeeded some help in figuring out where to start. How do I figure out which way all these confusing paradigms relate to each other, so that I don't spend time learning one bunch, only to realize that I was wasting my time all along?

"Reddit, do you think that University CS education places too much emphasis on programming/software development and not enough on the bigger picture?","I've been thinking about this since I jacked in my software development career after two horrid years.

Particularly in the UK (not sure about anywhere else), I've noticed this trend whereby Computer Science students basically spend four years programming endlessly, over and over again.  Almost everyone I know who's ever graduated from a CS degree (including myself), has ended up going straight into a non-descript bottom-rung codemonkey position without a second thought; a couple went on to postgraduate studies, some not even in IT related fields but the overwhelming majority of what I'd say was 85% went into software development.

I think the two are related - if you spend your whole degree coding, then that's really all you know and certainly for me coding was the only real and tangible ""skill"" I came out with.  Trouble is, I totally hate it which is why I've gone onto a Masters program dealing with network security and data forensics.  I love it and I'm likely to make a good bit more money in a much more interesting job and it's a near certainty that I'll never have to write another line of code ever again.

I actually attended two Universities in my undergraduate years, transferring just short of halfway through due to personal circumstances.  Both courses were taught in very different ways and had very different subjects and course material on the syllabus, but in both cases absolutely everything that was taught lurched back into software development at some point or another.  ""Today, we're going to learn about DNS... here's some Java code that does it"", ""Today, I want to talk about data structures... write some code to implement SuperDuperMegaListSort (even though Java has a couple of functions to do it for you)"", ""This is what we call agile development"", ""Test driven development"", ""OO modelling"", ""Here's an MSSQL database - code a front end to visualise the data in it.  Submit full UML, sequence diagrams, use cases and the kitchen sink with your assignment"", ""Design a program which can perform a Fourier transform on the supplied waveform""... ... ... give me a break.  Can we not just learn the theory in greater detail instead of banging out code all the time or continually going over and over software development methodologies?

At both institutions, there was a big final year project.  Again, it was software development; the whole lifecycle from preliminary bits and pieces, requirements gathering, the documentation kitchen sink collection including UML, use case document and diagrams, sequence diagrams, implementation, endless unit testing followed by evaluation.  Why couldn't we have had the choice of writing an advanced research paper on something which interested us, instead of banging out yet more code for the sheer sake of it?  We're told that the project is supposed to be relevant to our career plans - what if people have decided by this point that they don't want to be developers?

It's no wonder to me that so many graduates seem to be ending up in development straight from University, and end up staying there forever in even more cases.  In my experience, it really is all they know and it's quite sad that the IT industry is so wide ranging yet Universities are sending all their unwitting students down the same dark path.  I don't see CS graduates, I see armies of seriously mediocre, burnt-out ""programmers"" and it's no wonder that graduate recruiters are getting pissed off with it.

It seems to me that University just isn't worth it for computing anymore.  Most people can widen their career options by not even bothering; just take a few Microsoft qualifications, maybe sit the CCNA and you open more doors than a bland University degree with too much focus on development.

Take a hypothetical situation where you interview 4 candidates. They claim to have a good grasp on CS fundamentals, as well as know C#.


You ask them to solve a simple problem:

          Create a function that reverses a string.

You get back 4 unique approaches. All of them work properly:


        // Candidate 1
        static string Reverse(string input)
        {
            Stack&lt;char&gt; stack = new Stack&lt;char&gt;(input.ToCharArray());

            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
            foreach (char c in stack)
            {
                sb.Append(c);
            }

            return sb.ToString();
        }


        // Candidate 2
        static String Reverse(string input)
        {
            char[] chars = input.ToCharArray();
            int length = chars.Length;
            for (int i = 0; i &lt; length / 2; i++)
            {
                char t = chars[i];
                chars[i] = chars[length - 1 - i];
                chars[length - 1 - i] = t;
            }

            return new String(chars);
        }


        // Candidate 3
        static string Reverse(string input)
        {
            char[] chars = input.ToCharArray();
            Array.Reverse(chars);
            return new String(chars);
        }


        // Candidate 4
        static string Reverse(string input)
        {
            string result = String.Empty;
            if (input.Length == 1)
            {
                return input;
            }
            else
            {
                result += input.ToCharArray().Last() + Reverse(input.Substring(0, input.Length - 1));
                return result;
            }
        }

I just tried Python for the first time and am dissapointed,"Someone told me that Python can't sort Cyrillic and I assumed that he is wrong:

    if __name__ == ""__main__"":
            list = ['z', 'c', 'a']
            print list
            list.sort()
            print list

Output:

    ['z', 'c', 'a']
    ['a', 'c', 'z']

Great, I know Python! :) Now let's try with Cyrillic:

    if __name__ == ""__main__"":
            list = [""ш"", ""љ"", ""а""]
            print list
            list.sort()
            print list

Output:

    SyntaxError: Non-ASCII character '\xd1' in file testsort2.py on line 2, but no encoding declared; see  for details

OK, while in this day and age I expect UTF-8 to be the default encoding, it actually makes sense to specify the encoding explicitly, and it's great that they included the URL in the error message!

    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    
    if __name__ == ""__main__"":
            list = [""ш"", ""љ"", ""а""]
            print list
            list.sort()
            print list

Output:

    ['\xd1\x88', '\xd1\x99', '\xd0\xb0']
    ['\xd0\xb0', '\xd1\x88', '\xd1\x99']

WTF? Oh, I have to specify that strings are Unicode, even though I have just specified that entire file is in Unicode? Makes no sense, but I am used to jumping through hoops.

    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    
    if __name__ == ""__main__"":
            list = [u""ш"", u""љ"", u""а""]
            print list
            list.sort()
            print list

Output:

    [u'\u0448', u'\u0459', u'\u0430']
    [u'\u0430', u'\u0448', u'\u0459']

W-T-F?

Long story short, I tried to do this same thing with arrays (do not sort?), sets (also do not sort; also, why is array called 'array' and set is called 'Set'?) when, in a stroke of luck I tried this:

    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    
    if __name__ == ""__main__"":
            list = [u""ш"", u""љ"", u""а""]
            print list[0], list[1], list[2]
            list.sort()
            print list[0], list[1], list[2]

Output:

    ш љ а
    а ш љ

OK, this outputs correctly, but it doesn't sort properly. Then I tried changing the LANG environment variable, but it didn't work. I finally had to resort to the Sorting Mini-HOW TO:

    # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
    import locale

    if __name__ == ""__main__"":
            locale.setlocale(locale.LC_ALL, ""sr_RS.UTF-8"")
            list = [u""ш"", u""љ"", u""а""]
            print list[0], list[1], list[2]
            list.sort(locale.strcoll)
            print list[0], list[1], list[2]

Output:

    ш љ а
    а љ ш

FINALLY!!!

So, after this ordeal I believe I am qualified to answer the question that pops here often: ""Why is PHP more used than Python?""

PHP makes no false pretenses about something working when it does not. PHP does not support Unicode, but it doesn't claim that it does, and everyone knows this. This is why, if I wanted to sort Cyrillic, I would google for the solution and not even try doing it the obvious way. As for PHP's inconsistent function naming, we see that Python has that too, and more (I mean, inconsistent **printing**?). Also, PHP's documentation has code examples, and a separate page for every function, while Python's is generally unhelpful.

For the record, the equivalent PHP code:

    &lt;?
    
    setlocale(LC_ALL, ""sr_RS.utf8"");
    $list = array(""ш"", ""љ"", ""а"");
    print_r($list);
    usort($list, ""strcoll"");
    print_r($list);",programming

Anyway, all I'm trying to do is read from a Table in a SQL database. I'm connected to it and everything is set up. All I want to do is read from the Table, do a bit of processing and write to another Table.

So,

Do I have to Dim some variables called 'Week', 'L1', 'L2' or do I assign new variables to take the values, e.g. NewWeek, NewL1, NewL2? If so, do I simply write, NewWeek = Week, etc.?

How do I loop through to the end of a Table in a database? A for next loop?

* Tools for editing levels adding models that sort of thing.

* A Repl or scripting language to control the logic.  I don't think he has the patience to recompile a large program yet.

* Hopefully the language is usable outside of this environment. Something similar to Python, Scheme, Smalltalk...

* Good documentation.

* A place to share stuff online.

* Access to the physics and graphic library in-case he gets curious about such stuff.

How much do you argue when an interviewer is just plain wrong about a solution?,"How far do you argue the point in an interview, when an interviewer is making clearly incorrect assertions about the ""correct"" solution to a problem?

Examples from an interview I was just in:

    public class StringExperiment {

        private String myString;

        public void print(final String s) {
            myString = s;
            System.out.println(myString);

            se.print(""goodbye"");
            System.out.println(se.myString);
        }
    }

The interviewer stated that because Strings are only ever stored once in memory in Java, the above would print out hello / goodbye / hello. That's clearly incorrect.

He then followed that up with the problem:

 * Given a string of indeterminate length, how do you find the character that occurs the most in that string and print out both the character and the total?

I gave him a couple of solutions (O(N + K) / O(N + Log N)). He asserted that the best solution was walking forward through the array, using String.split() with each character encountered, and then counting the number of substrings returned in the array.

Ask Proggit: Can somebody help me understand gps fleet tracking?,"This is my first time posting, so please take it easy on me. I have built a 'Campus Map' for my University with Google Maps api, and there is a rumor that they are going to outfit the shuttle buses with a gps device.  Today, the rumor became reality, so I have been reading as much as I can about 'gps tracking'.  

My boss expressed that budget concerns are a huge factor, and they would try to implement their own 'system'. A  couple things I don't fully understand are the gps units that is used, and how this unit transmits data (mainly the coordinates).  I have found several proposals from other Universities that utilize a service called NextBus, but nothing about how this technology actually works.  

I think this would be something cool to try out and definitely give me a break from web applications.  Any advice or how I should get started would be great.

**Edit:** Thanks for the comments, I understand the concept, and believe I could do this with a tomtom or garmin device accompanied by a pc.  Our VP ran across a iphone app that tracks the gps from the phone, (which I have already built) but this is were the cost comes into play, they don't want to pay for smart phones for the 15ish shuttle buses.  

We have two campuses in the city, and the city doesn't have a blanket of wifi, so I believe we would have to use some gsm/edge transmitter.  The idea is to replicate the Ohio State University's bus tracking system on their mobile site (m.osu.edu &gt; ""what's close?"" &gt; Buckeye Village).  OSU shows a bus stop, then does 'real time' tracking to show how many minutes until the bus arrives at that location.",programming

What languages did you learn in what order?  What did you learn *from* them?,"In a recent walk down memory lane, I thought about how I learned to program and what languages I learned in what order.  For me I think it was

* TRS-80 BASIC / MS BASIC (~1985), when men were men and BASIC had line numbers, and ""IF X THEN FOO"" threw me for a loop.  ""If X *what*?""  And the extra 0.77 in 4.77 MHz made a difference.  *(Raise your hand if you know what I'm talking about.  :)*
* Pascal / Turbo Pascal
* 8088 assembler
* Read a book on APL.  A very nifty language.
* LISP (via Scientific American, of all things) (and I'm pretty sure that back then it was ""LISP"" and not ""Lisp"")
* C / Turbo C (~1990)
* A semester each of FORTRAN, Ada, 68k assembler, and Modula-2 in college (class of '91), though I wouldn't really say I ""learned"" any of them.  I do think it was Modula-2 that left me with an abiding hatred of case-significant languages with CAPITAL keywords.  **\*shudder\***  It was funny and kind of neat learning FORTRAN and seeing the parallels to BASIC, though of course I quickly realized it was the reverse.  :)
* ksh
* Awk
* Perl (~1994?).  Someone told me he was going to rewrite my Awk-based code generator in ""Puddle"".  He had to show me *Programming Perl* before I realized that he was just rolling his R's.
* Does Vim-script count?
* C++
* Common Lisp (~2001 and later)
* Java
* A scattering of Javascript, Python, maybe some others

Somewhere along the way I implemented a (toy) LISP interpreter in Turbo Pascal.  Implementing READ made me really understand recursion, and implementing lists made me really understand linked lists.  Later I wrote a clone of a then-popular BBS game called ""Tradewars"", and independently reinvented breadth-first search as a shortest-path algorithm (and leaving me with a (so far) life-long fascination with the Traveling Salesman Problem).  (My version of the game never took off.  The real Tradewars universe was 2-dimensional and static -- the same everywhere you played it.  Mine was 3-dimensional and different everywhere you played it.  It made mapping ... difficult. :)  Generating a universe randomly and making sure that you could get from A to B for all A and all B taught me about network traversal.

I'm pretty sure I've implemented Conway's Game of Life in at least four of those languages.

So anyway, I was interested in other Redditors' (""Reddit*er*s'""?) history and experiences.

Do you regularly make use of C# struct?,"I've been using C++ for years and am now learning C# for a job. The author of the introductory book I'm reading (O'Reilly's *Programming C# 3.0*) says that he almost never uses structs and that few programmers use them more than once every few months.

I find this surprising. As a C++ programmer, I always think about whether I want to allocate memory on the stack or the heap. It seems to me that for a relatively small datastructure that has a short lifespan, a C# struct is perfect. Why incur the cost of a heap allocation if all you need is a stack allocation? Isn't a heap allocation expensive in C#? I expect the runtimes must have to enter a mutex, which could put your thread in a wait state, and there's the reference tracking and garbage collection... it seems to me that you'd want to use structs whenever possible.",programming
Ask Proggit: Looking for some quick CRUD in PHP that has templating and (hopefully) some ORM. Framework or other suggestions?,"I usually work with Django/Python and Perl (please ignore my crusty user name...) and I was wondering if there were were any frameworks or suggestions for where to start on the PHP side.

The section on the site this will be used needs only to display a list view of the items and a details view of each item. The back-end need only allow the usual CRUD magic with simple auth.

Thoughts on helping out at old workplace (for free),"This may seem odd. But I left my old programming job last year in a bit of a bad way. 

The staff were good and although we had some moments, most of the things were probably my fault.

I was splitting up with a girl, kid involved, got in a bad way with my already bad drinking and pissed off my work, friends and most strangers in every bar.

So I was thinking since my freelance work is finishing up next month and I have a window of 2-3 weeks where I am free (was scheduled just for my own time off) and I was thinking I could get in touch and offer to help out with any projects they have (it's a busy time of year).

Maybe take on something that takes 2 weeks max or maybe fix anything I may have left broken. This will obviously be for free.

I don't even know if they would give me a reply or even if it is legal, I'd be working from home so no passwords and I'd need to use fake data.

Newbie LGPL compliance questions; any of you OSS license experts out there today?,"Hey all—we are investigating the use of an open source product (call it FOO) licensed under the LGPL. There are a ton of other projects which use this product, either without modification or with modifications. 

In most cases, those secondary projects are also released open-source and licensed under the LGPL. I've encountered a small handful of projects that:
- Distribute FOO, including modifications, as source
- Distribute themselves as static libraries, no source included (but sometimes the header files for the static library). They also usually include make files which allow the whole package (static library+FOO) to be built and used as one.

Questions:

1.) Are those latter projects actually in compliance with the LGPL? I think so, as they appear to meet the terms of section 6.a:

&gt; Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable ""work that uses the Library"", **as object code** and/or source code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing the modified Library.

but this part is hazy for me.

2.) For projects that distribute their own product as a static library, is it legal for us to link our product to that static library and use functionality from it in our own projects, provided we also distribute our product with FOO's source in compliance with the LGPL, and the static library provided by the other vendor? 

Thanks for your help. These licenses are often treacherous to navigate.

help with solving problem: fair &amp; random selection of max # of people for a game/event.,"My work has a weekly basketball pickup game, we were using a sign up sheet to get a max. of 15 players each night, but there's now too many people that want to play, and so the sheet fills up so quickly that many people are complaining they don't get the opportunity to sign in on time... I'm thinking of a randomizing picker I will create to solve this problem, can anyone think of a fairer solution:

Game is on wednesday, people can sign in from prev. thur up to monday. The 15 Player selection happens mon. night as well as identifying 3 on a waiting list. If you're picked but need to opt out last minute you can do so tue, wed and the waiting list players get bumped into the game... 

First week, all people signed in for the week get 10 balls from which the selector will choose. If you have played the prev. week, you only get 8, prev. 2 weeks 6, etc...

For each week if you had not played the previous week you get an additional 2 balls, to a max. of 10, (but only if you did not opt out last minute)...

This method of selection I think is fair, gives players that have not played the prev. week a BETTER chance of playing, and ensure certain players are not winning the lottery EACH week...

Ask Progit: You've been tasked with developing a touch screen kiosk...,"Hypothetically speaking, you've been tasked with a project to develop software for touch screen kiosk (40) for various museum exhibits.  

Essentially, the software is pretty simple.  The goal is to provide data regarding each specific exhibit.  The user can navigator 1-3 screens per kiosk to gain additional information on the display.  Additionally, there needs to be a content management side so authorized users, such as a curator, can maintain the data located at each exhibit.

I am NOT interested in design of the software this is a standard MVC approach.  I am interested to hear what programming language, packages/libraries, etc. you would use in this scenario and why (ex: C++, C#, Java, Qt, Boost...).  Granted your selection may be dependent upon the OS and overall hardware deployment.

That leads me to the second question/part.  You need to determine the required hardware specifications.  You have the option of building out a custom case/chassis and selecting independent hardware and building the kiosk yourself, or purchasing an all-inclusive unit from an OEM.  

Keep in mind deployment and maintainence of such as system.  There needs to be a decent GUI display, so I'm not sure embedded linux would be able to handle this.  We might have to go with a full on desktop OS.

Let me be honest - I freakin love what C can do for me. I love a lot of things that is provides and the problems that it's such a perfect fit for. I use it when it makes sense to - and accept the tradeoffs of using it. There are a lot of cool things it does, a lot of things I can screw up, but it works in the right situation.

Range based loops... adding completely new loop syntax to an already mature language? So, for something like:

    for(int &amp;x : my_array)
    {
         x *= 2;
    }

How am I suppose to debug that? How can I tell where I'm at in the iteration? So now begin() and end() are API's the language knows about?

Labda expresions...now we introduce non-C style function definitions. As if it wasn't difficult enough to debug with the advent of overloaded operators, now we get:

    std::for_each(someList.begin(), someList.end(), &amp;total {

Brainstorming the best theortical operating system.,"So proggit lets brainstorm the best theoretical operating system. I'll throw my points you add or prove why idea's are bad. Most are just thoughts of the moment so they may be rough around the edges.

+ Files are seperated into objects based on type. e.g text, data, etc so a simple rm binary::text::debug would remove all debug info.  
+ Filesystem is distributed and log based with checksumming and active deduplication based on objects instead of blocks or files.  
+ Serialization is done by the kernel so fine grain object based security can take place, effectively removing acl's and uncomplicating user access.  
+ Virtual machine based with safety checks on non-verfied programs.  
+ Mostly written in a term-rewriting (or lambda calculus) based functional language thus allowing hotpatching of machine code from bytecode due to no side effects (useful as an optimizing trace cache aka java's HotSpot) without having to implement architecture specific trace caches.  
+ Base install has basic frameworks for tree structuring config data and system statistics.  
+ Each program is separated into it's respective components gzip a wrapper around huffman and lz77.  
+ Using the statistics framework workload can be simply distributed based on load of each machine.  
+ Processes can seemlessly migrate.  
+ Self modifiable kernel can optimize based on statistics (cache misses, etc) and is allowable since there is capability based security.",programming

Working on my HS Programming Curriculum,"I am looking for feedback on the new teaching approach that I am going to try.  I would love any help that I can get!

Last August began my first year teaching High School level computer programming.  I have changed my approach in both teaching and grading nearly once a month trying to strike the right balance between freedom and guidance.  Programming is pretty broad, and everybody comes in with different ideas of what they would like to learn from it.  I have tried giving them full freedom over how they spend their time learning, which the top 10% love, but the bottom 90% either can't manage their time effectively or can't think of anything to do at all.  When we all move in lockstep on projects, the 90% will do their work, the 10% are bored, and nobody's really happy because the projects aren't something they have much interest in.

So here is my latest grading scheme, which is based loosely on video game levelling in the hope that I can give some of my students an unhealthy addiction to achievement:

I came up with as many reasonable programming fields as I could that might strike interest in a student.  These are basically my character classes.  They can level up in each one by accomplishing certain tasks in each.  For instance, to become a +1 Game Designer they need a player that can move around on the screen in Pygame.  To level up some classes, they may need to work on others (To be a +1 Hacker, you must be a +1 Web Developer as well as a +1 Networker).  The base class is ""Programmer"", which includes most of the things required for the class.  By the end of Programming 1, they should be a +3 Programmer.  By the end of Programming 2, they should be a +6 Programmer.

Their grade each term will be based on how many levels they gain.  I'll need to decide exactly what will be the appropriate difficulty, but it may be something like +6 levels in a term earns an A, +5 a B, +4 a C, etc.  The difficulty of each semester will therefore depend on each student's individual rank.

I also threw in achievements they can meet separately, because kids are suckers for achievements.

Eventually I will write a website that keeps track of each student's levels.  They will be able to log in, take tests to gain levels, and view their achievements.  Their stats will carry over to the next year.

My rough draft in progress is here.

Feedback that I would love:

* Whether this is a good idea or a terrible idea and why
* Project ideas for different classes
* Other class ideas
* Other achievement ideas
* Links to tutorials or resources in different areas (since everyone may be working on different things, after the first few weeks they will be mostly learning on their own with me offering help when they are stuck.  I think it's better for them this way anyway).

How does the iPhone interact with various free software licenses?,"I am embarking on an iPhone application project with a friend of mine, and there are a lot of features and libraries we'd like to use, but they are all in various free licenses.

1. Can I use free software on the iPhone?
2. Can I use open source software on the iPhone?

"Could someone explain why Apple keeps producing products with multitouch, but I still can't find an Android/other device with a multitouch screen?","I was hoping someone could explain why Android phones don't have multitouch. What is the technology behind it? Is it a hardware thing, or purely software? I have a vague knowledge of touchscreens: (Correct me if I'm wrong)

-A device such as a Nintendo DS has a pressure-sensitive screen which pinpoints a single pressure point on an x-y plane.

-An Android phone has an... electro-static screen that approximates a single point in the middle of where you press on the screen. (Probably wrong)

Question for Java programmers: how do you live without delegates?,"I'm coming to Java (for portability reasons) from a C# background. I'm working on a little interpreter for a programming language, and I find myself having to copy and paste code a lot more than I would like. Here's an example:

    // parses ""a; b; c...""
    private Expr semicolonList() {
        List&lt;Expr&gt; exprs = new ArrayList&lt;Expr&gt;();
        
        do {
            exprs.add(keyword()); // &lt;- calls different function here
        } while(match(TokenType.SEMICOLON));
        
        // only create a list if we actually had a ;
        if (exprs.size() == 1) return exprs.get(0);

        return new ListExpr(exprs);        
    }

    // parses ""a, b, c...""
    private Expr commaList() {
        List&lt;Expr&gt; exprs = new ArrayList&lt;Expr&gt;();
        
        do {
            exprs.add(operator()); // &lt;- and here

        if (exprs.size() == 1) return exprs.get(0);
        
        return new ListExpr(exprs);
    }

The only differences there are the TokenType being matched (which could easily be passed in as a parameter) and the subsequent function to call (which *can't* be passed in).

Is there some idiomatic solution to this that doesn't require me defining an entire interface and class to wrap `keyword()` and `operator()`? Or is there a nice syntax for doing so?

Suggestions for Structure in C++ Game Programming?,"I have a question that will very likely be quick for some of you to answer: what is the canonical structure for games written in C++?  Until now I've been using a ""C with Classes"" approach, iterating over an array of objects.  But the outer framework is all C.  No factories, no gameworld class.  No gamestate class.  Collision detection is handled by a function.

This works pretty well for me but it's become my understanding that I'm sacrificing a great deal of power and flexibility by doing it this way.

One positive thing about doing it the way I have been is that I never have memory leaks and I very rarely have insoluble bugs.  My objects are ""dynamically allocated"" but within an already-defined array.  It is simple and manageable and I suspect the way that I do it is probably faster than equivalent canonical C++ code but the speed savings isn't somewhere important. 

Any thoughts?  Any resources that you specifically recommend looking at?  I'm just looking for a high-level overview of general framework, something I haven't really been able to find online or in the literature.

"Class inheritance, memory pools and avoiding garbage collection pauses.","I'm writing a game for Android. I need to avoid garbage collection from causing pauses so I need to allocate all the memory I need at the start of the game. I know I need to use memory pools, but cannot figure out the details. Say my class tree is something like this:

Entity

-Player

--Monster

---Monster1

---Monster2

-Bullet

--Bullet1

--Bullet2

As a memory pool needs to return objects of the requested type so they can be recycled, does this mean I need to have one memory pool for each type of object in my tree? It seems I can waste a lot of memory if this was the case as I need to guess how many of each class will be needed. Sometimes I've considered just merging several of the classes into one by making a union of the fields (so some objects would contain unused fields depending on how they were used) and adding a 'type' field so I can tell how to use it; however, this makes for more procedural code.

Another issue is how to keep track of references. For example, I want a list of Bullet objects that are in the game world that I can iterate over. I don't want to use e.g. Vector because removing from the Vector is expensive (it shifts object positions) and iteration requires creating a new iterator object (which can cause the GC to fire).

Starting to read the BeOS Bible; wondering the meaning of a quote...,"I came across this quote as I opened up the BeOS Bible:

&gt; *An oracle at Phrygia declared to the people that their next king would arrive by oxcart. As fate would have it, a poor Greek farmer  named Gordius arrived and tied the wagon of his oxcart in the temple of the oracle's god just as the Phygians were selecting their next king. The people, seeing this, selected Gordius as their ruler.*

&gt; *King Gordius tied his cart where it stood with a knot so complex and intricate that no soul would be able to untie it. Legend has it that whomsoever could untie the ""Gordian knot"" would come to rule all of Asia. Many tried, and many failed.*

&gt; *One day, Alexander the Great arrived in town, and was taken with the challenge of the Gordian knot. After trying and failing to untie the knot though conventional means, Alexander drew his sword, and with one swift blow, severed the oxcart from its post.* 

&gt; The best solution to a complex problem may begin by working downward from perfection, rather than upwards from chaos and confusion.

This came after a short story of Alexander the Great and the Gordian Knot.

I was just wondering what it meant- especially with the story that came before it. I never heard a problem presented in that manner- and so can anyone give an example of a situation that calls for this manner of thinking?

"Hi reddit, here is a raytracer with some dubious GI i wrote in HTML5 :-)","At friday, i was waiting for time to pass until an arrangement i had, so i decided to write a raytracer in HTML5 while i was waiting. This afternoon i decided to finish it and when i had it working, i thought to add some GI-ish rendering too (indirect lighting). Not sure what kind of algorithm this is, i just came up with it while writing it :-).



Needs HTML5, Canvas, etc. Tested in Chrome and Firefox, although i highly recommend Chrome if you enable the indirect lighting. The difference between Chrome and Firefox is huge - half of it is the fact that Firefox always updates the whole canvas but even without it its still about 5-6 times slower in my computer (so its about 11 times slower with the updates).

Opera, Safari, Konqueror, etc not tested. Feel free to post speeds :-).


**Spoiler alert!** If you want to see the pretty image without waiting hours for Firefox to finish rendering (chrome only needs about 14 minutes), check  :-)


**EDIT**: I added web workers. Its my first web worker use, so beware :-P
Here is the web worker enabled version: 
Use a value from 1 to 16 in the *workers* field. With 16 workers in my machine, Chrome now needs 3mins and 45secs to render a full frame (with antialiasing and indirect lighting enabled). I'll check some suggestions made later, but for now i need to sleep :-P.

My dad already payed him $50 down, and was going to pay another $200 upon delivery. However, I feel that this site needs some more work before he finally pays for it. What changes would it be appropriate to ask for?

Using online examples plagiarism without credit?,"An interesting question came up when I was in class today. A discussion on weather using algorithms online or from disassembled code without crediting them is plagiarism or not came up. There wasn't a clear line about this, because plagiarism can be defined as using an idea without credit, which algorithms could fall under. 

An example that I brought to the table was: what if a professor assigns us to implement a binary tree? Would it be plagiarism if we looked online for an implementation example and used that idea without crediting it in our code?

It's hard to say what's common knowledge in programming. Are examples posted online considered common knowledge once their posted, or should they be cited in code, like in papers? If, yes, it should be cited, then what about common algorithms, like for loops or recursive factorial methods? Those might be common knowledge for some students, but new ideas to others.

I know this isn't really a problem in the ""real world"", but I think in academia it needs to be clearly defined, because we don't want professors accusing students of plagiarism. On the other hand, we also don't want students copying and pasting code and submitting it without learning it. So what does proggit think of this?",programming

Lala Song Metadata Backup Script Written In Perl,"

I really put some effort into building my music collection on the website Lala.com and to my demise I learned a few months back Apple was purchasing the company.  Recently, Apple has taken the initiative to shut the website down on May 31, 2010 and all funds you have under Lala will be transferred to the i-Tunes store.  Unfortunately they have not given the option to transfer your web songs (songs within the cloud) to the i-Tunes service.  So, I have no idea what songs are in my collection, without perilously writing each one down.  I recently contacted Lala about them providing a means to export all of my song metadata to an XML file and was promptly denied.

I spent a few hours digging through their API and found out that they send all of there data through JSON via AJAX request calls. Bam!  That's all I needed.  I wrote a small Perl script that signs the user in (Secure Connection) and then asks the user what format they want the data in.

Cryptographic time capsule thingie.. Is it even possible?,"I got this idea from seeing all those Hollywood movies where if you change one bit in one file, the whole system blows up in smoke and sparks. Now, that's not entirely what I'm looking for, so bear with me.

Imagine an encrypted system that works on segments of data. There are two operations defined.

1.) Decrypt segment(id) - decrypts a single segment. No other segment must be decrypted in the process.
2.) Add new segment(blob) - append a new segment to the system and encrypt it with the system key

The idea is that at any point in time, you can decrypt any segment, independently of any other segment. So far, so good, this is trivial. What I'm going for is some kind of ""entanglement"", for lack of a better word, such that if you attempt to change the plaintext of one segment and save it again, the rest of the system remains in an undefined state and none of the other segments can be decrypted.  

Now, you would say, ""But you have all the plaintext! You can just take it all out, do what you want with it, and save it as a new system."" And you would be right. The point is to obscure the process and raise the barrier a bit. Obviously, you can take the hash of each segment and check for it in the software but I was hoping for something more ... systematic, algorithmic, if you wish.

Basically, what I'm hoping for is an algorithmic method to get as closest to non-volatile memory as possible. I know it's impossible but how obscure can I get in terms of getting back to complete volatility?",programming

The thing is, now I am worried I cannot go back to what i was doing before, I simply can't. I love this far too much. The problem however, is that the company I've been working with is a small startup.

Reddit Tools - I coded a simple tool for Reddit addicts.,"**Reddit Tools by Teraso 1.0**


**PGP Signature File**


**PGP Public Key:**


**Source**


-----------------------

I coded a simple Windows program for Reddit.com addicts, in part to prevent panic attacks when a notice is seen that Reddit will be going down shortly for maintenance.

You can load the first X number of pages of reddit (or any subreddit you wish) simultaneously, each in a seperate browser window.

So even if you see that Reddit is only a minute away from shutting down for maintenance, you can still load 20 pages almost instantly to prevent you from going into withdrawal.  :)

You can also load the Nth page of reddit (or any subreddit you wish), which is particularly useful when you use it with the ""New"" option, which sorts the posts as if you had clicked on the New tab in Reddit.  That means you can load the 50th page, sorting chronologically, with only two seconds of effort - instead of doing it manually, clicking the ""Next"" link page after page if you were doing this directly in a browser.


It's completely portable, so no installation is required, and it should be compatible with most browsers.


This is v1.0, so if anyone sees any problems, just let me know and I'll see what I can do to fix it.


Maybe some of you will find this useful.  If not, just delete it.  :)


Notes:

1.  The link pages look rather sparse.  Don't let that fool you.  Just click the ""Download"" link to grab the file in question.

2.  There's a link for a PGP signature file so that the authenticity of the ZIP file can be verified (using my PGP Public Key, which there is also a link for).  If you don't have PGP, or don't care to verify the file, than just ignore them both.  :)",programming

"Sanity Check: Typical Client, Typical Issues... see inside","So I'm working for a client, trying to improve things and add things that are missing to the project Ive been handed.  Of course it's a mess, that's why I'm being handed it which is fine, but after i refactor and fix all the stuff like having to comment out 75 lines of test code and uncomment 20 lines of production code when deploying the project, I realized that there's no README file (I added comments of course but that alone is still a pain and would be confusing b/c you'd have to read all source files, all comments just to make sure youre not missing something key).  Now that I've added configuration controls, I want to let any other future developers/deployers know how to operate and configure the application.  (It's only one boolean variable that has to get set from a config file basically (and a db config string))  So I add a README file.  Before I commit i ask if the client allows this standard of practice.  He says no.  So I'm expecting a wiki or something like that and he says ""we use the comment section of the vcs when you're committing to add stuff like that.""  And since I wanted to continue getting a paycheck i said, ""oh, seems odd but ok, will do.""

Rant: don't force unnecessarily complex tools on developers/contributors,"I've spent evenings and bits of weekend for the past two weeks trying to build a vanilla big-endian arm cross-compiler toolchain. Again, and again, and again I ran into brick walls where some configuration option wasn't quite right, was incompatible, broken, or simply incomprehensible. I spent days worth of time googling options, and looking through scripts and code. I have a good page worth of notes that anyone wanting to build an ARM cross-compiler toolchain should know, and it still isn't enough.

I have given up for the time-being. I am using an older toolchain.

The first thing I tried to do with this older toolchain, was compile an old project (openmoko-calculator2), which requires configuring the thing with om-conf. Which fails, because of multiple obscure reasons which I am still sorting through.

This is typical of my experience with Open Source.

Note that I am an experienced programmer - I worked on Unix systems for the first time about 30 years ago.

Back then, it was also difficult: the documentation was also bad or non-existent, the namings obscure, and help sparse. And we didn't have google. And yet back then, it was still *much* easier. The difference is the extra tools: now, instead of just understanding a compiler, linker, library and the target code, I must also understand several configure scripts and their different obscure options, and autoconf and all the different programs it also drags into the equation (like perl, intltool, etc., etc.). Do not tell me I don't have to understand them: they break - all code breaks - and then I, as someone who has little to no interest in them, have to go and look at what broke and why in order to get to the project I really want to work on.

**tl;dr:** don't make your tools more complex than necessary, don't use unnecessary tools, and don't use unnecessarily complex tools for your project. They make life hell for people trying to help you.

**Edit:** Thank you, whoever down-voted my post.

You can call it whatever you like, but in my mind I call it ""Music Madness"" in reference to March Madness. It's a tournament app for your music library. The app could take however many tunes from your library (the number could be configurable by the user, maybe) and create a tournament bracket out of them. You could seed the entries by play count/skip count, so strong entries play weak entries early in the contest.

The app would show you the whole bracket, then zoom in to the top left and would play five seconds from one song then five seconds from another. The user would then pick which he liked better; whether he does it based on his opinion of the song or the opinion of the clip is up to him, but he decides who ""advances"" to the next round. The bracket gets smaller and smaller, and when the game is done the winning track is automatically added to a playlist in iTunes.

This would definitely get me to listen to the music I sometimes forget about in my library and would be an easy way to kill five minutes in line at the bank or something. Definitely something I'd be on board with.

"Greetings, proggiters. I'd like some help/advice with a personal programming project (Windows). Apologies if this isn't the right place.","Sorry for the vague title, but there's so many ways I could do this that it's got to be. This might be a bit long-winded.

Right, the project: I want to create a simple interface for selecting and playing backing tracks (and possibly metronome) for my (real) drums, running on Windows XP. I want to use my (PS2) Rock Band drum pads as the navigation tool.

I've been a bit out of the programming game for a while - I mainly do web programming now. I am proficient (but rusty) in C and C++, with a passable knowledge of x86 assembly. Not sure I should mention this for fear of booers, but I also extensively used VB6, back in the day, complete with embedded ASM and all that jazz. Recently, I've also toyed with haXe [flash] and Löve 2D.

So, back to the project. I've used Löve to make a cheap-and-dirty electronic drumkit, using the Rock Band pads, so that's fine. In fact I was amazed at how east it was. So I _could_ do the whole thing with Löve, except... I want variable-speed playback, which Löve doesn't offer :(

I've got variable-speed playback in Winamp, which is easy to control programatically via windows messaging. Except for the variable-speed playback, which is a plugin and may not respond - I haven't tried yet. And I can't use Löve to send windows messages, unless I invoke `os.execute()` to run a program which does.

On the other hand, using C++ I could call winamp easily, or use a sound library with variable-speed playback (BASS looks promising). But last time I tried accessing the Drum Pads using `joyGetPosEx` or `joySetCapture`, it didn't work.

I've heard tales of PyGame (or was it Pyglet?) that might make this easy. But I'm not sure it has the audio functionality I need, and I don't speak Parseltongue - although I can pick up enough to get by fast enough, I'm sure.

So from my point of view, it looks like I either need a cobbled-together hodge podge of trigger apps and launcher apps, or to get down and dirty with a full-blown C++ project using libs I've never used before. But maybe there's a simpler solution lurking out there?",programming

What level of knowledge for listing a programming language on a resume is acceptable?,"I've been updating my resume and I was going over the programming languages that I've used or learned in college.

"Got a shitload of uh... pictures(!) on your computer organised into folders? Point a simple webserver at it, and browse it from your iPhone!","So a while back I realised I've been hoarding uh... pictures(!) for a long time, hundreds of folders fastidiously sorted into categories, but that I never actually look at (or watch) any of it. At first I thought it was because I was only interested in NEW uh... pictures(!), stuff I hadn't seen before, but then I realised no, it's actually an issue of accessibility.

So here's what I did:

* I installed Apache and PHP by way of MAMP]( (or [WAMP.

* I created an alias for the root level of my uh... pictures(!) directory (which is buried for purposes of obfuscation) to the httpd.conf file. This is good for two reasons - if you're on a public/work network, and someone stumbles across the fact that you're running a webserver, it's unlikely they'll just guess your alias name (aliases don't appear in Apache directory lists), and it means you don't have to use your uh... pictures(!) folder as your webroot (so it's just that little less visible). Here's the alias line I used:

    Alias /z ""/Users/myname/Documents/Projects/PICs/API/""

(It's been a long time since I did any PIC programming...)

* This works pretty well, but the Apache directory listing is a terrible format, and I wanted it to display all of the pictures from one folder on a single HTML page, so I could scroll through them. So I made a simple PHP script that does exactly that. You can get it here.

If you drop that script in your root level uh... pictures(!) folder, and call it index.php, you should now be able to wander around your collection from your iPhone.

At the moment I'm working on a new version that uses javascript for a better interface (like resizing images so they're more uniform in scale, and taking advantage of the iPhone swipe jQuery API, and adding a sprinkle of AJAX so instead of grabbing a whole folder at a time, it only gets the current image, and the next 3 or 4 - the iPhone baulks loading much more than 15mb of images on a single page. I may also need to make some sort of thumbnail screen too ... might need to implement swipe 'up' and 'down' for navigation.

Anyway, just thought I'd up this in case anyone can get some use out of it, and take to opportunity to ask if anything like this exists already anyway. Have fun looking at your por... uh, pictures!",programming

"WebM solved the video problem, but will it also solve the Audio (element) problem?","Currently some browsers support MP3 others support Ogg/Vorbis or maybe even (HE-)AAC. Since WebM uses Vorbis for the audio stream we could always use that one, right?

WebM doesn't imply support for the Ogg container, but I'd be also fine with using Vorbis inside WebM for audio stuff.

Now, what's missing is some statement from browser vendors that this will also work (with Flash for example this kind of thing doesn't work, its `Sound` class cannot handle audio streams from video files) and of course some handy command line tool to convert Ogg/Vorbis to WebM/Vorbis.

"Empiricism vs. theory: How many people need to be in a room for 2 to have the same birthday (month/day only, not year)?","Actually, the question was about matching the last 4 digits on credit cards (because someone thought that it was way too coincidental for me to have the same last 4 digits on my card as the company card). 

Out of curiosity, I thought I'd see what the odds were. There were 2 ways to do this: either go read a whole bunch of old notes from statistics class or write a brute force program to just repeat the test a few times. I took the brute force route...seriously, less than 5 mins worth of code, because it was pretty trivial, but it occurred to me that even though the mathematically pure solution would've been much more elegant, it sure would've taken a while to figure out, and even then, there aren't any opportunities for breakpoints in mathematical formulae and calcualations for you to really evaluate whether you're getting the right answer, whereas with code, you can tell whether you're doing makes sense or not, because you can evaluate the intermediate products of a brute force test more easily than those of a half completed math calculation. 

What do you think? Am I approaching this all wrong?

Anyway, the answers (based on this program):

* 126 credit cards need to be in play and on average, 2 will have the same last 4 digits. 
* 25 people need to be in a room on average, and there will be 2 people with the same birthday.

Determine if a sequence is an interleaving of repetitions of two strings,"Hi /r/programming.  I've been up all night doing my homework for algorithms class, and I've gotten everything done except this last problem which has been stumping me for half the day.  I was wondering if anybody out there could help shed some light on it, not necessarily the solution algorithm but where to begin?  I'm having trouble even coming up with reasonable subproblems.



&gt;Suppose we have two transmitters, each of which sends out repetitions of some short string. For example, transmitter 1 may repeat string x=101 over and over, so what we will hear from it will be a pre fix of x^k - that is, x concatenated to itself k times, possibly with a few bits chopped of the end (as in 10110110). Transmitter 2 repeats another string, y. Our job is to determine if a sequence s that we have heard is an interleaving of these two transmissions.

&gt;For example, suppose transmitter 1 repeats x=101 and transmitter 2 repeats y=01. The sequence 010111010101 can be unraveled into x and y: positions 1, 5, 9, and 12 contain 0101, a repetition of y, while the remainder of the string contains 10110110, a repetition of x.

&gt;Describe an efficient algorithm which takes a sequence s of length n, and two strings x and y, and determines if s is an interleaving of repetitions of x and y.

In 1997 Netmanage killed Ecco Pro. Today a thriving community of users still exist for this program and they have done some amazing things with it.,"Ecco Pro was/is one of the best information managers ever written. Netmanage bought it for three million dollars in 1994 and killed it in 1997 at the height of it's popularity for no apparent reason.

Some years later they put the binaries on their FTP server and made it available for free but has refused to release the code despite continuous pleading by the community.

People have done some amazing things with it using DDE, and hacking the binary itself in order to fix bugs and add functionality.

Imagine what would happen if netmanage had open sourced it instead of just killing it.",programming

I am looking for a good (Tortoise)SVN-Tutorial for a non-Programmer,"Hi everyone,

yesterday when idling we zapped through my media-collection and found the talk of Linus Torvalds about git and the computer scientists of my friends discussed points of CMS, while ""our"" chemistists where pretty much out of the loop. We tried to explain the pros of using a CMS not only for code, but did not do a very good job out of it.

Is there a tutorial that lets you start with checking out from a local drive with TortoiseSVN, explains updating, checking out, comitting, merging, solving conflicts and then perhaps shows setting up an account at a free subversion-hoster?

If not, I would have to write it myself. :-)",programming
"Programmers of Reddit: non-programmer here, want to get involved, need advice on where to start.","I'm not very technologically savvy.  I keep up-to-date on the latest from Apple, Adobe, etc., thanks to Reddit, but I don't understand half of what is said in the tech articles.  But I do know that the tech industry is growing like a toddler on steroids, and I think it might be smart to start dipping my feet in the pool.  So my question is, what technology should I acquaint myself with, what sites/blogs should I start following, and what language(s) should I start studying?

I have lots of side projects and not sure how to organize myself.,"Heres the story - my 8 to 4 job is paying all the bills, but not leaving any 'fun money' so I started taking small side projects to make extra money.

Good news is that now I have a few projects to work on, some have a 1-2 week deadline, others have a 6 month deadline etc.

Which programming language should I start?,"I want to find a new programming language to play around with, but I have no idea which would be the best. I would like to try a powerful language that will have actual applications to my usual nerdyness.

What's the best OS for running emulators on 128mb of flash?,"I have an HP thin client with 800mhz Transmeta Crusoe Processor, 128mb flash/ram. The ideal setup would be a system that boots into an emulator and allows the selecting of games with a joystick.  

I'm thinking the best option is to go with Windows XPe (XP embeded) and I could make a simple interface with VB3.  Perhaps there's a linux distro that is specially suited for such an application, like something for a MAME cabinet?  As you can see, space is a major factor.  I'm not really trying to fit every game in existence on it, just a couple 2-player games such as Darius Twin, Rock and Roll Racing, and Mario Cart.  I suppose I could put more on a USB stick, but I'm thinking I might not really need to.",programming

[Ask Prog] Why does a language documentation must suck?,"This is not a rant, I just wanted to ask some real programmers why do they put such awful description such as this.

I started learning python yesterday (even though I have been programming for a couple of years now) and I must ask WHY ???  I understand the docstring to be bad because they want to make it short but why is that so badly written :

&gt; get(key[, default])
Return the value for key if key is in the dictionary, else default. If default is not given, it defaults to None, so that this method never raises a KeyError.

From here

Can't they use simpler explanations ? Like :
&gt;get(key[, default])
Return the value for *the* key if *the* key is in the dictionary, else *the function will return the* default *value*. If *a* default *value* is not given, it *sets the* default to None, so that this method never raises a KeyError.

My explanation might be wrong, but I'm still trying to piece what this function does.",programming
ext4fuse: mount ext4 partition on mac or any other fuse platform,"I've been working with this for some time, and it has reached a point where I no longer feel embarrassed to show the code :). I wanted to be able to read ext4 partitions on my mac, and I was curious about ext4 so this is the result:

* 

Mostly works.  I haven't been able to break it for some time and it's quite fast when reading (directory traversal is not so much).

I'm not so sure how it reacts with ext3 partitions converted to ext4 though. And of course, it's just readonly. But I thought it might be interesting for some of you guys. And I'll be pleased if you can give it a try and tell me how it works for you (feel free to use the issue tracker on github)

To get this working you need macfuse (I got it from darwinports but that's just one of the options).  If you want to run the tests, you'll need some box that supports ext4 natively.  If you want to compile it you need to install one compiler, of course.  But you can get also get a binary here:

Using the QT IDE on Linux for C++ Development.,"I didn't like most of the C++ IDEs I tried, they seemed bulky and got in my way, but I tried again in the QT Creator that I had tinkered with before. I imported a simple C++ project into the QT IDE on linux, and it seems to work fine, but when I look up 'C++ IDEs on Linux' it is no where to be found.

It seems clean, it seems fast, it has a nice set of features. So, is there any reason I shouldn't be using this?",programming
Does anyone else think that python is terrible?,"For the longest time I used PHP for web development but it got frustrating to use for larger sites. I did some work with JSP and Hibernate and I realized Hibernate was so amazing that I couldn't program another site without it. I didn't really want to use JSP though since I felt it made things a bit overcomplicated so I ended up choosing Pylons with SQLAlchemy.

I've done a bit of work now and I don't understand how anyone can *stand* python. The API naming ""convention"" is horrible. There are so many single letter abbreviations and inconsistent names. The import system makes reading code impossible: I don't know if anything is a module, class, or function name and I have to keep scrolling to the top of files to find out. Not having access modifiers is insane. The ""docstring"" syntax is ugly.

Does no one else have these problems? How is it possible to use a dynamically typed language with large projects? :(",programming

"Hey Reddit, Here's a new and improved Javascript Bookmarklet to view all images in a thread!","This code automatically shows all images that are linked in the comments.

**New Features:** You can now drag your mouse on any image and it will zoom in and out! (Zoom! Enhance!) There are also little [-]/[+] buttons that will hide/show individual images.

**Edit:** Another feature: There is now a &amp;#8635; button to rotate the image in increments of 90 degrees! (thanks to mitchelwb

This is an extension of an idea originally implemented by drowsap. Please pay him due karma/congratulations for the original idea and implementation.

**Directions:** Select&amp;Copy the following line of code and paste it in place of the URL in your adress bar. Hit enter and wait a few seconds for images to load.

Alternatively, you can create a bookmark and paste the code as the url/address. Then just click the bookmark any time you want to see images.

Code:

------

    javascript:document.ondragstart=function(){return false};dst=function(e){return (p=Math.pow)(p(e.clientX-(rc=e.target.getBoundingClientRect()).left,2)+p(e.clientY-rc.top,2),.5)};$(""[href\x2a=imgur]"").not($(t=""[href$=jpeg],[href$=gif],[href$=png],[href$=jpg]"")).each(function(){this.href+='.jpg'});void($(t).not("".EGraw,.click-gadget a,.domain a,.thumbnail"").attr({'class':'%45%47%72%61%77',target:'blank'}).each(function(){$(this).append($('&lt;span /&gt;').toggle(function(e){$(this).html(' [-]').nextAll().show();return false},function(e){$(this).html(' [+]').nextAll().hide();return false}).click()).append($('&lt;img&gt;').attr({src:this.href,style:'display:block;max-width:780px;height:auto',title:'Drag to resize'}).mousedown(function(e){(t=this).iw=t.width;t.d=dst(e);t.dr=false;e.preventDefault();}).mousemove(function(e){if((t=this).d){t.style.maxWidth=t.style.width=((dst(e))%2At.iw/t.d)+""px"";this.dr=true}}).mouseout(f=function(e){this.d=false;if(this.dr)return false}).click(f)).append($('&lt;span /&gt;').html('%26#8635;').click(function(e){(i=$(t=this).prev()).css({MozTransform:r='rotate('+(t.rot=(t.rot?(++t.rot):1)%4)%2A90+'deg)',WebkitTransform:r,filter:'progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.BasicImage(rotation='+t.rot+')',marginBottom:(m=t.rot%2?(i.attr('width')-i.attr('height'))/(1+(nie=!$.browser.msie)):0)+'px',marginTop:(m=nie%2Am)+'px',marginLeft:-m+'px',marginRight:-m+'px'});return false}))}))

Please feel free to:

* Try it out! It should work on this image and any others posted in this thead.
* Replace your old bookmarklet with this version
* Paste code&amp;directions in picture threads and rake in mad karma!
* Confirm the integrity of the code to fellow redditors, if you know JavaScript. Blindly running unfamiliar code can compromise your privacy! The code is quite messy on one line, so paste it into JS Beautifier to get a better view.
* Give suggestions. I'd be glad to make improvements/add features by popular request.
* Ask questions if you're curious how it works. I'd be happy to explain.

I have some elementary questions about Object Oriented programming. I hope reddit can help.,"To give a bit of background, I am not a programmer. I am an engineering grad student who has written code for (mostly) simulations. My questions are

1) What is the purpose of OOP? I have heard about concepts like encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism, but what is the benefit of these ideas to a programmer?

2) I have never used OOP concepts when I code. Am I missing something? 

3) Why is OOP so popular?",programming
