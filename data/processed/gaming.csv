Please help me figure out why it's so tough for me to connect to Valve games. It's driving me insane.,"4 times out of 5, when I try to connect to a Valve game (TF2, L4D, L4D2), I'll be able to join a game lobby with no problem whatsoever. Then, once the game starts, the progress bar will stay at 5% and say ""Failed to connect after 10 retries"". This really sucks when I'm trying to play with clanmates or whatnot and can never connect to their god damn server.

Sometimes, after I get that message, I restart my computer, restart my router and modem, and then there's maybe a 30% chance of the connection succeeding.

I have forwarded ports 27000-27050 on TCP/UDP to 192.168.1.3 on my router.

Settings: 

Windows Vista

connected by cable to Netgear WGR614 v9 wireless router

Router is connected to Zoom Cable modem

I can connect to the internet just fine otherwise, it's only when actually connecting to a game that it fails.

Right now I'm staring at Mass Effect 2, concerned I'm going to disregard anything I need to do and just vid for a week straight.

"Something you might not know about steam, that could save you some frustration in the future.","So today I was going through mass effect 1, having a good old time, when suddenly the game crashed. Further investigation showed that it crashed upon attempting to load a new section of the game. I went and looked online for the map file to replace my corrupted one, but I couldn't find any and resigned myself to redownloading and reinstalling the game.

However, I discovered an option under game properties called ""Verify integrity of local cache."" Upon running that option, steam checked out my installed game files, reported that it had found six corrupt files, and automatically downloaded those six files. It took maybe 5 minutes, and my game was up and running once more.

So yea, if anyone ever runs into a persistent crash on a steam game, check that option out before reinstalling.",gaming

"Imagine... Black &amp; White, the gesture-based god game, ported to the iPad.","The whole ""hand of God"" control scheme would no longer be a metaphor. You would be tickling/slapping your creature, performing miracle gestures and dragging yourself across the land with your actual hand, not just by proxy of a mouse or trackpad. To zoom in/out, use the OS-standard pinch-to-zoom. To change your viewing angle of the world, you could turn the iPad around in your hands, or tilt it, and the built-in accelerometer will interpret and change the display accordingly. 

Make it happen and make a fortune, Lionhead Studios.

**EDIT** (copied from a reply I posted below):  
The reason I mentioned an iPad-specific port is that its features and hardware are standard in *every* iPad, and there is a marketplace already setup specifically for its users: the iTunes App Store. Yes, there are other tablets that have capacitive screens, multi-touch gestures, and accelerometers, but how many have all three? And what percentage of the tablet market do those specific products hold? And even if its user base was significant enough, how does EA Games market - and sell - a game specifically for them?

Like it or not, the iPad has garnered a lot of attention (more than any other tablet), and the iPhone has proven how successful the app store distribution model can be. I think the iPad is a logical platform choice, and a Black &amp; White port could be quite successful.

Also, purely speculation, but I imagine that given the original Black &amp; White was released for Mac, the port to iPad would be fairly easy to do compared to other PC-only games.",gaming

Game Idea: GTA MMO but it's free to play as the cops.,"I realize that there are some mods out there for the PC GTA games to allow multiple players raising hell at once--and of course the new GTA games have multiplayer options--but we've all dreamed of a true MMO version.  I guess the concern would be that the city would be a clusterfuck (a beautiful one) 24/7.  My stab at a solution: More cops--the natural GTA enemy.  I get that you'd have gangs and thugs of all sorts running everywhere, so who'd want to play a cop?  Answer: Everyone who doesn't want to pay.  They'll get standardized weapons and vehicles, etc.  And they get the chance to ruin the paying players day.  

Has something like this ever been done?  Is it a shitty idea?

Edit 1: ""free to play"" should be read as free as in money free--you don't have to pay as a cop, while the (normal?) criminal players DO pay.  I didn't mean you COULD be the cops, but a simple reworking of the tiered pay or no-pay system.

Edit 2: I don't work for Rockstar games, and don't develop video games professionally.

Edit 3: I suppose I should have been clearer in the original post.  I was attempting to create a unique playing model by finding a way to compensate for ALL the havoc a GTA player could wreak without having to instance off the action--this would allow GTA cities to have 100's of players in it as once--by having many cops that could supplement the bots to keep a lid on things.  In GTA world, this would add incentive to drive like a normal person to avoid the eyes of the law, and not kill everything in sight, (well, sometimes).  Regardless of the specific game format, the ability to play a limited, tertiary role in the game FOR FREE while allowing people to try the game that way, providing a fun, unique model for everyone I thought was an original idea.  My original post did not make this clear--for that I apologize.",gaming

I just got Metroid Prime Trilogy and i have to say that Bioshock has nothing on this...,"When people talk about Bioshock, usually the word immersive is thrown around a lot. I defiantly felt that when I played it. The world, characters, and gameplay all came together for a tremendous experience. The list assumes after your first play through, not on repeats. As we all know, any game you play more than once, loses some of the wonder it has.

However, after playing through the first Metroid Prime, I can say that Bioshock's immersion pales in comparison to MP. It can be broken down as follows:

1. Character: Bioshock is a FPS, so you automatically feel like you are the character. That is about as far as it goes, though. In MP, on the other hand, you are Samus. You're in her helmet, you see what she sees, you react as if you are Samus. You scan, shoot, jump, dodge all as if it is really you. There really is no comparison when it comes to feeling like the character.

2. World: I will say that Bioshock has a incredibly detailed world that is done incredibly well. However, i felt the locations started to feel kind of the same after a while. ""Ooh, another water drenched hallway...yawn"". MP's world is also very detailed and well done, but the big difference is that there is different areas that feel different, but come together in the end. You have a lava cavern under the surface, chozo ruins above, an arctic area, and a mining area. All of these areas work together to make the planet believable, but feel different every time you step off an elevator. 

3. Weapons: I will concede here and say that shooting lightning and fire from your hands is awesome. MP has great weapons, but the sheer awesomeness of Bioshocks powers help edge this ahead.

4. Exploration: The only reason to explore in Bioshock is to find recordings and the usual FPS fare (money, ammo, etc). In MP, you want to explore. You need to see every square inch of the world to find every expansion for missles, power bombs, and energy. You want to explore just to see the world that waas made and to experience every nook and cranny.

So there you have it. I can still appreciate Bioshock, but when it comes to full immersion in a video game, Metroid Prime is king (or queen, Samus is a girl you know)",gaming
"My gaming idea, google streetview finally made it possible?","Ever since the GPS in-car displays came out I've had an idea for a racing game that I thought was revolutionary (at the time). Though fast forward several years later it still hasn't been utilized...

Basically the idea was to have a program able to render a racetrack based off of GPS data (Now Google street view has much more accurate information than the satellite / GPS). 

The whole idea was that the consumer would be interested in re-creating routes they often take, to work, school, to the next town. across the country etc.. Then be able to take a variety of vehicles and see just how fast they could get to their destination when they don't have to worry about full life consequences.

Happy Birthday id Software,"On this day back in 1991, a little four-man PC game development house was born, and you may have heard of it. It’s called id Software and they were making waves in the shareware market with games about an adventurous little kid called “Commander Keen”. They’ve come a long way since with their Wolfenstein, DOOM and Quake games and have changed the face of gaming forever. They started out with just four members, and today, only two original staffers are still there. The office has grown in leaps and bounds over the past few years and they now boast a staff roster of over 100 talented members working on a few “AAA” titles at once. The other big thing this year is that this is the first anniversary where id Software is no longer a privately owned entity since the buyout by Zenimax. A lot of things have changed over the years, but they’re still id Software and they still make the games that drive many people’s dreams, including mine. So happy birthday id Software, and may you have many, many more!

Any good FPS games with really good shooting?,"As a fan of shooters, I have noticed a few things. There are different types of FPS games depending on what they focus on. Some games like Half-Life involve great set pieces and wowing the player with a lot of action, great story and an immersive atmosphere. Others such as Fallout 3 focus on more role-playing style gameplay. While both of these games are amazing, the kind of shooter I find myself enjoying the most are the ones that focus just on the shooting gameplay.

Ever since I got Killzone 2 about a year ago, I've found other FPS games a lot less fun. What does it for me is how the movement and shooting *feels.* The movement feels very weighty and takes momentum into account, the aiming also takes into account the weight of the gun you are holding. The shooting feels better than any other game, with the recoil making you aim each shot before pulling the trigger (unlike in Call of Duty where you can aim while shooting.) The way explosions shake the screen, and muzzle flash lights up a room also help with the immersion.

So what I want to know is, what other games out there have really good shooting gameplay? Games where the movement and aiming don't feel so *arcadey* like in Call of Duty?'

One of the hardest and best parts of the game was being forced to choose which teammate would die during the final mission, I wanted to see all of them in the third one. As much as I hated doing it, I felt it made the game feel much more real, as not every character gets a happy ending (like choosing Ashley or Kaiden).

I love the heatclip/ammo integration to the game, it requires much more strategy then firing your gun until it overheats and taking cover to switchguns or let it cool down.

I am also very glad that money and minerals have a purpose in this game, money was worthless in the first one except for specter weapons and the minerals did nothing.

The combat was much harder which was a relief, the first game was incredibly easy mid-game. There was also a huge variety of enemies, which I _love_ to see in any game.

As you can see, to get from rank 11 to 12 takes almost 100 million exp / score points. It's making me think that they threw that in there to create a leveling off for the beta as to not give people too much of a head-start.

So, what's the word reddit? (Besides bird that is.)",gaming

I made a game that just became a finalist in the Indie Game Challenge!  Would you kindly...,"...vote for us?  I apologize for the self-serving post and I usually wouldn't ask reddit for any favors, but I honestly believe that you guys are one of the most supportive web communities out there. Anyway, here are the details.

I helped work on AaaaaAAaaaAAAaaAAAAaAAAAA!!! - A Reckless Disregard for Gravity]( over this past summer and it's done pretty well.  So far we've nabbed an IGF nomination and won Editor's choice for Best Indie Game of 2009 over at [moddb.   I'm a student looking to break into the industry so an award like this would be huge for me as well as the rest of those guys over at Dejobaan.

If you haven't checked out Aaaaa! yet, then I highly recommend it.  It's a great game to play during a 10-15 minute break and we put a lot of work trying to make it a unique experience.  It's available on Steam, Direct2Drive, Gamers Gate, Impulse, Wild Tangent, as well as directly on the Dejobaan site.  If you're the kinda guy who likes to try before you buy, then there's a demo here.

Thank you guys so much for your support.  It really means a lot when the community gives back to the small indie studios.  For those of you attending PAX East or GDC, hopefully we'll see you there!

"The Bad Company 2 beta/demo has been public for a week now, anyone have any thoughts about the game? I have a few.","I think the best way to review it so far would be to compare it to the original, so here is my whack at it:

Note: I speak from playing the Xbox version, I'm not sure how it will differ.

___

**In general**

So far my favorite thing about the new one vs the old one is the bullet drop and less ability to just spray n' pray. In the old one, you had 50 rounds in an assault rifle and if you could see them, you could pretty much hose them down. *Now* you have to take careful aim with every weapon, and distances play a great role. Also, the option to nade spam is basically gone now that you only get one grenade.

___

**Assault Class**

The big difference here is the ammo supply. Instead of having ammo boxes fixated on the map, the assault class has to supply ammo, and they forced the necessity of this by making everyone only able to carry 2 or 3 clips (the sniper gets 5). I think it's a cool idea, but at the same time I know I'm going to end up without ammo and some asshole on my team will never drop a box. The whole making you more dependent on your team is cool, but xbox players tend to be dumbshits.

___

**Engineer**

So, they combined the support and the special class into one. It works well. A little funky transition, but it does work. I like how now you can look down the sights of the smg.

___

**Medic**

He gets a lmg, and the thing is damn accurate so long as you don't move while shooting it. You won't hit shit while moving, however. He still drops med packs, blah blah. The big thing with this class is the ability to revive. That is *really* fucking cool. Not enough are using it, however. Also, as a sniper I've already taken the opportunity to shoot one in a squad and wait for the medic to run out to revive him and headshot him as well :D

___

**Recon**

The sniper. Bullet drop is now a major consideration. I don't know about any of you, but I got really pissed that the bullets wouldn't drop in the original, because I would always compensate and then see bullets whizz over people's heads from across the map. This is going to define the difference between shitty snipers and good snipers. shitty snipers will (hopefully) get tired of not hitting anything and play as something useful instead of sitting on top of hills while their teams lose. Good snipers will royally fuck up teams from a distance unless someone takes them out.

___

Now, a special note:

**The shotgun**

Bad company finally has a shotgun that doesn't suck. A while ago, someone had a post about defining a game by how good it's shotgun is. This is a great game. It is the perfect ambush weapon for when you want to sit in the foliage at a chokepoint and blast away people running right at you, or when you have to defend an objective in a household you will dominate if you can aim. Any class can equip it too, even recon, so you can have sensors and clear out a whole house. They made it limited in clip capacity, which is good because otherwise you can end up being unstoppable if you can just gun down an entire team by yourself.

___

Other thoughts, the Tanks are tanks, they do what they've always done in Battlefield, RPGs now have to hit them in the rear however or they do very little damage, which makes sense. The Heavy MG is a **BITCH** to kill when you don't have any rpg or tank support and it doesn't seem to suffer from bullet drop, which is kind of cheap. Please, put bullet drop on the goddamn machine gun EA. UAV is cool too. Weak, (a sniper shot and two pistol shots destroy it, I found out), and everyone stands around the computer to get it, but that's just battlefield players for ya, always standing around the single weapon that has a long-ass respawn time, and then they crash it into a tree.

___

So Reddit, what are your thoughts?",gaming

"Sometimes, a video game comes along that has this certain aspect that causes me to be unable to put it down.","Bear with me here, this is going to be a bit odd to explain. Sometimes a game comes along that sucks me in so much, that I can't help but play it, and *only* it, until I complete the game (or at least get as far as I can). I can only think to describe that feature as ""gradual introduction of features/rewards"".

Some examples I can think of off the top of my head are:

Harvest Moon (most of the series)

Might &amp; Magic: Clash of Heroes

Zelda (again, most of the series)

Knights in the Nightmare

Mario &amp; Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story

I'm sure there are others, and better examples, but that's just a little rundown to give an idea. Basically, it's when a video game starts off as fairly simple (not always, but usually), and as you progress, more elements are introduced. Either through items granting you new abilities, or new game elements as you progress through the game. Essentially, it's the polar opposite of games like standard FPS where you are dropped in and told, ""here's how the game is played, now go play it"". Don't get me wrong, I love FPS, but the very start of the game is really no different from many hours later.

A lot of RPGs do this as well, but sometimes it's all expected/cliche anyway (new characters, new magic, new areas, yawn). There's also a close relationship with collection in this aspect of games, I've noticed. Harvest Moon, for example. You start out with a tiny house, on a crappy farm by yourself. But over time, you expand the house, plant crops-a-plenty, keep multiple farm animals, get married, have a kid (and sometimes play through multiple generations), and generally the near end/end of the game is far more complicated than the start. Games like Knights in the Nightmare, on the other hand, are complicated as hell from the very start. Yet, you learn how to play better as you go. You pick up on better strategies, what items work best on what, what units are most effective in situations, etc. 

So r/gaming, I ask you, am I just being picky here or has anyone else noticed/cared about this? Also, what other games can you think of that might fit this little category I seem to think exists?

Dear Gamers of Reddit - Why do console kids think they have more skill than a pc gamer?,"I have been friends with a few people that consider themselves gamers and they strictly play on consoles.

"Dear r/gaming: Logitech customer service is nothing special, don't be fooled","I have a G7 mouse, barely over a year old and the batteries started dieing on me. It takes ages for them to charge so my mouse is constantly dead unless I leave the battery plugged in for 24+ hours.

On January 5, I alerted Logitech. The first reply was: ""No problem, replacement batteries are on the way."" I thought: ""Wow, their service really does rule!""

Fast forward to 3 days later and my mouse is really starting to die, even though the battery is apparently almost fully charged after leaving it in to charge for something like 24 hours, the mouse stops working; every single minute it just freezes randomly for anywhere between 5 and 20 seconds. As someone that makes their living with a computer, this got ridiculously annoying really fast. I did everything from using their recommended tools to reinstalling drivers, but the problem persisted.

I sent Logitech another inquiry and after a few back and forths, they agreed to have me send the mouse in to have a look themselves. Queue 4 weeks later, not only did I never receive my replacement batteries, I also never received the pre paid package to send the mouse back to them. All my subsequent inquiries have been ignored.

5 days ago I sent a final inquiry to let them know about the situation and the problem has been apparently escalated, but not a single reply explaining anything. It's just sitting there and continuous updates on my part are left unanswered.

Logitech support is nothing special and my experience with their mice has been horrible. I had an MX revolution that lasted 5 days in the past and I had to take it back because it was faulty. The store (not Logitech) were sold out of the MX, so they gave me a G7 and the difference in cash back. The G7 lasted barely a year.

Just letting everyone hear a different point of view about Logitech, they are not better than any other company and do not deserve the extra praise because one other guy got lucky.",gaming
Need some help with good multiplayer games for the 10-14 year old bracket.,"Here's the story:

I was recently contacted by a local elementary school looking for me to teach a two week after school program concerning online gaming. The principal specified that she wanted games that pitted children from her school against other schools in the region. The only problem is, due to funding problems and age restrictions there's quite a bit of the ""good"" games that are going to have to forfeit.

So far I have Battlefield Heroes. That's it. I'd like to have at least one or two more games to cover in this timespan. 

Here are the requirements:

E or T rating, and I will have to review the T rated games to make sure they're ok. It's not that I don't think the children can handle them, it's more to avoid backlash from parents.

Cheap or Free. I've looked into Civilzation IV, but I'm not sure if the $20 bucks will be too much for these kids/their parents. This is a fairly poor rural school I'll be teaching in. 

Entertaining! I'd like to show these kids how much fun this passtime can be, so I'd like to avoid any ad-ridden free games or simply poorly produced ones.

The art style was fantastic, the soundtrack (while a bit repetitive) fit the pace really well, and the combat system was intuitive yet challenging. Very few games made full use of the DS's hardware like it did, and very few RPGs have the amount of replay value that TWEWY displayed.

Just finished Mass Effect 2...,"I played ME1 when it was first released, and again last week to get a new character to import.  I started playing ME2 this past Sunday and just completed the game w/ a 26h 20m completion time.

Throughout the entire game, I loved how much my ME1 save mattered, especially just playing through the first game last week.  They really spent a lot of time on that and I appreciate it.

I completed every major side quest, unlocked every character and did their side quests, upgraded most weapons and my ship fully (spending a lot of time mining).

I didn't care for the dumbed-down weapon and character development systems, but the improved combat made up for it an I'm in no way complaining about that system.

The part that ended up kinda ruining the experience, which really bothers me, is the weak final mission.  It's like they spent all this time crafting a great experiencing and the final mission was the opposite of epic.  In general the game lacked a specific bad guy, and the random final boss battle was awful.  I know ME is planned for a trilogy so they obviously had to end it open, but so many things in the last part were handled hastily which tainted the experience.  It seems obvious that they rushed to finish the game, or couldn't come up with a good way to end it.

"Hey GamingReddit, I'm running a video game marathon for charity. Rate my ideas/suggest more!","Hey GamingReddit:

A group of friends and I are running an online video game marathon for charity. We're racing through games. So, two people will play through the same game, with first to the end of the game winning. We're also playing through two different games at the same time, to maximize the interest in games. If you don't like one game, you might like another!


So, here's the gist: Two channels, one ""RPG"" channel (a loose characterization) and an ""Action"" channel. Here's the lineup of games we have scheduled (we may not play all these games due to time constraints, just some of the ones we're considering):


RPG Channel:
Final Fantasy VI, Chrono Trigger, Pokemon Red/Blue, Secret of Mana, 
Final Fantasy IV, 
Secret of Evermore, 
Final Fantasy Tactics. 


Action Channel:
Donkey Kong Countries, 
Old school Mario games (Mario 3, World),
Halo,
Link to the Past, 
Doom 3 (Being done at graveyard hours, will be interesting. Neither of the players have played this before),
Mario 64, 
Mario Kart(s), 
Sonic Games (Sonic 2, Sonic &amp; Knuckles games?), 
Starfox 64, 
Goldeneye, 
Bomberman 64, 
Super Metroid, 
Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, 
FEAR (Again: Being done at graveyard hours, will be interesting. Neither of the players have played this before) 
Ocarina of Time.


We're also streaming commentary not only from the gamers themselves, but from the extra people who aren't playing at that time, etc. This should hopefully keep the commentary more involved and interesting. Sometimes the gamers focus too much on the game and not enough on the commentary (or vice versa!). 

Some miscellaneous info: 

This is going to be a 60 hour marathon, from ~noon on Friday until possibly late night Sunday into Monday, depending on how fast we get through the games.

We have yet to pick a specific charity but are thinking some charity for kids with cancer (St. Jude's is the obvious choice, but they get plenty of help already. They don't need more, :)).

We have embedded an IRC chat window into our website, so people can tag along with that (or through an alternate IRC client if they prefer). We'll need mods to deal with that.


So, I'm looking for suggestions. Clearly there are a *lot* of these types of things going on. I think what we bring to the table is superior commentary (We're a pretty entertaining group of guys, if I do say so myself...), some variety of gaming (something for everyone here), and pretty good organization. Frankly, I think the key to this is going to be appropriate use of social media. I know Reddit REALLY  helped out with the ExtraLives marathon, certainly in viewership but also in donations! So, I want to know what you guys think to help us plan this out.  So, what do you guys like to see? What would make you watch? What would make you donate? What ideas do you have? 


I'm also looking for a few people who are willing to help mod the chat/promote the event. If you have some experience or ideas with this, please send me a PM or make a comment and I""ll be sure to get in touch with you. Proper promotion here is going to be the key to getting this going.",gaming

"The opposite side of the spectrum: What low-rated, hated game did you find yourself really enjoying?","Just thought I’d put this out after seeing What big, highly-rated game did you not care much for?

Sometimes you’ll read a review about a game that the reviewer clearly dislikes. You hear about bugs, repetition, linearity etc etc. But when you start playing the game, you think “am I playing the same game these guys hated?”


Some examples for me – Assassins Creed 1 – I read alot of comments about repedative missions and bland combat, but I found myself really engaged with it when played in small doses.


Mercenaries 2 – could be glitchy and cheap, but it was FUN

"Reddit, can you help me out? Looking for a good immersive/atmospheric game to play.","I'm tired of non-stop action in my games, things happening at breakneck speed requiring you to react, react, and react. I'm tired of running through levels, racking up kills-per-minute, and if you stop, discovering that there's nothing to see or do except continue the rampage.  I'm sick of the ""story"" games where you listen to NPCs' 30-minute monologues too (looking at you, Dragon Age!)

What I'm looking for is a game where I can spend most of the time enjoying the ambiance, exploring, watching things happen. I guess that kind of game has to be fairly good looking and detailed to be enjoyable.  Do you know of such games?

System Shock 2,

"Reddit, does anyone else think that 99% of stories in games are terrible - even the praised ones?","Does anyone else that video games need to have better writing?

Bioshock. Metal Gear Solid. Final Fantasy. Kingdom Hearts. God of War. Half-Life. Mass Effect. Gears of War. These are all games that have, at some point, been praised for their storyline. But am I alone in thinking that the stories in these games suck? Am I the only that can't button through these stories fast enough?

For my money, there are a few people actually doing it right. Half-Life used to have terrible stories but decent dialogue, but the inclusion of Erik Wolpaw and Chet Faliszek into Valve has shaken things up - which is why Portal, Left 4 Dead and TF2 have so much great dialogue.

I think the old LucasArts games and their alumni - Double Fine (Psychonauts, Brutal Legend) and Telltale Games (Tales of Monkey Island, Sam and Max) have terrific writing and excellent stories.*

Planet Moon Studios (Giant: Citizen Kabuto, Armed and Dangerous) have writers who jot-down excellent, top-notch comedy dialogue.

**CPU**: Core i5 I5-750

**HDD:** Samsung SpinPoint F3 1TB

**Case:** Arctic Cooling Silentium T3 Pro

**DVD:** LiteOn iHAS324

**OS:** Windows 7 Home premium

@Xbox Owners - Is anyone else and their friends getting RROD'd like crazy? Explanation inside.,"So, I had just gotten home from work where we stayed late to help a friend apply a RROD fix kit to his brother's 360 which had gone out of warranty.  This was about the third RROD I've heard of from close friends in the last week or two.  When I sit down to run a couple MW2 games with my boss and coworkers, not 5 minutes in I get a graphics lockup and when I reset - BAM - RROD'd.  

I called up Microsoft and they were very quick to process a repair ticket. I told the rep about my friends who each had different generations of Xbox's all getting RROD'd. He told me that in the past several weeks, he's been processing A LOT of RROD tickets from people who were playing MW2 when their console gave up the ghost.

So I'm curious fellow redditors - has anyone else had their Xbox assassinated by MW2?  I know this is a broad generalization and nigh impossible to prove, but it does seem like some uncanny timing. I would either put it up to a bad Xbox patch or MW2 patch at this time.  Any others?",gaming

What makes Diablo 2 much more lastable then Torchlight?,"Both have the same type of gameplay except Torchlight is newer, prettier, and has a ton of cool and handy features.  So why do I find myself preferring to play through Diablo 2 for the 278th time?


I have put it down to a few things; 


* Character variety and customization.  One of the best things about D2 is that there are 7 different classes which all play very differently.  In addition to this, there is about 5 or 6 ways to play each character.  You can play a poison necro (my favourite), a bone spell necro, a curse necro, a summon necro, a golem necro, and a few others just on that one character.  Where as in Torchlight there are only a few powerful spells per each character, and since they are maxed out at 10 you can usually use all of them without the need to specialise at all.

* Environmental Variety.  The environments in Torchlight look spectacular.  Every single different area has excellent little details and beats out Diablo 2 visually in almost every aspect.  However.  They are all essentially the same map with a different skin. Diablo 2 had large open areas you could run around, then you would go down into cramped and narrow dungeons, it had buildings, caves, fields, jungles, etc.  Each area looked different and felt different as well.  As good looking as Torchlight's areas are, they are all the same when you get down to it.

* Loot.  Torchlight rains down loot upon the character, especially once you level up treasure hunter, you are finding something unique or set every couple of minutes.  This severly undermines the value of such items.  In D2 finding a unique/set outside of a boss run is awesome because it happens so rarely.  That, and they are usually significantly better then what you are using.  Torchlight lacks hugely powerful unique weapons, the type that you will have trouble ever replacing because they are just so good.  I have never used a weapon in Torchlight longer then a few hours before it is replaced by something better.


This is what I put the main differences down to. What are you thoughts on the matter?",gaming

Game (or Level) Idea: Controller Training For Young Kids,"I've got a son who is about to be 4.  He's seen me playing games and has recently gotten more interested.  We have a couple PS3's and a Wii in our house so those are the platforms (or controllers) that I'd be interested in.  All of the games we have are pretty much too complex (or age inappropriate) for him right now.

I put him on a free run mode on a mostly circular track and he right now is still running into the walls and getting very frustrated.

What I need is a level that is essentially and infinite plane in all directions with no obstructions.  That way he could drive and if he turns wrong, the worst thing that happens is the car drives around in a circle.  But he'll never get stuck.

is this happening to anyone else? am i right, that games are getting worse and the ideas more stale, or have i 'grown out' of gaming as a genre?

edit: i might add i am a superfan of RPGs (i love the levelling systems) but even still i find it hard to come across one that isnt shit. ff12 was appalling and when the final fantasy games start getting shit, you have to start worrying!",gaming

I miss the adventure game genre.,"My favorite games of all time are still Sierra/Dynamix adventure games of the EGA/VGA era. Some of the best games I have ever played came out of this genre, whether it be the cheesy love story that is King's Quest VI, the goofy space adventure of Space Quest III, Laura Bow II's murder mystery, the epic teenage saga of Willy Beamish, or Quest for Glory I and its several classes that generated multiple puzzle solutions.  Sure, I've enjoyed many recent games with high resolution graphics and hours of voice acting, but there is just a certain charm that 90s adventure games had that I miss.  There is something so rewarding about only using an inventory to defeat a game's puzzles and bosses, rather than shooting or resourcing an enemy to death.  Maybe I'm overly nostalgic and just enjoy reliving my youth in gaming, but is there anyone out there that enjoys these types of games more than any other?

Edit:  Thanks for the suggestions all!  I now have plenty of new adventure games on my plate to play.  I do love modern games and non adventure games (I have already played through Mass Effect 2 twice), but the Sierra/Dynamix/LucasArts adventure games of the 90s are the only ones that I consistently go back to year after year for a great story and experience.",gaming

BFBC:2 Impressions from a COD guy. A couple questions for you bc vets as well.,"So I've been an avid cod fan for a long time, I played bc1 on the 360 (playing 2 on the ps3) and didn't find it all that enjoyable. However, I am terribly impressed with bc2 thus far. Graphics are pretty good; sound is top notch. I really like the destructible environments and the ability to drive vehicles, etc. Also: matchmaking has been flawless for me. As of late I've spent more time frustrated due to matchmaking in mw2 than I've spent having fun. (The constant lag, host migration is a joke, LONG matchmaking queue times - etc) BC2 has been a breath of fresh air to say the least. 

Now that I'm done gushing over how great this game is I have a couple of questions. First, how the heck do I fire the minigun when manning the uav? I can't figure it out for the life of me. I know it has one as enemies mow me down with it. Second, I get that the concept of rush is to defend / attack the mcom stations, but what are the values represented on your minimap indicative of? (E.g attackers: 54, defenders:0) They must be points but I haven't got a clue as to what they mean, how they're earned / lost. 

Finally, any pro tips for a bc n00b? I've been playing mostly recon and seem to be holding my own but would appreciate any pointers.

So I went by the GameStop at the mall today...,"The store manager was asking some kids for a trade.

AskGaming: Fresh ideas for failing internet/game cafe in Canada? Willing to consider human sacrifice at this point...,"Hi reddit, 

I work with a struggling (yet ruggedly handsome after a few beers) internet/gaming cafe here in tropical northern Canada. With the onset of winter and Mass Effect 2 keeping kids in their parent's basement, this place has been, well, damn lonely. No meat in the seats make for angry utility providers and no cheddar in the till means no AVP or Bad Company 2 licenses. To offset the winter attendance dip, we organize weekly tournaments, WOW raiding party parties (mostly because we love saying party twice in one sentence) and 1/2 price days. We're afraid our promos are growing stale--as fewer and fewer people are attending--and have decided to try and re-freshanize some of our programming. The problem? We're hella stumped. 

We're in dire need of new, fresh and 'out there' ideas. We have the tech, the smarts and clammy skin but lack the creative might to get kids out and spending their parents money. We need fun, social and unique events that can breathe life back into already great multiplayer games. Cheeky spins, creative competitions and gimmicky one-offs; help reddit!

After a lengthy brainstorming session which eventually turned into a Hot Rod eating competition, we've come up with: 

* An L4D a-la-glorious anaglyph/retro 3d event (see: 
* A Serious Sam HD 16 player co-op campaign lock-in event

The first one is my idea; the other I don't like. Can reddit help? Whatever ideas we use, we'll totally give you internet cred. We'll work your glorious name (even image) into our event posters for Facebook and sing tales of your deeds in the local pubs. Chances are that as a result, you'll get famous, have sex with girls and score free flying lessons.

**Shop Tech:**

* 11x PC (Core 2 Duo E8400, 3GB, 8800 GTS, Vista x86)
* 1x MAME unit w/ X-Arcade Dual Joystick
* 2x XBOX360
* 1x Wii
* Games: We stock pretty much every staple multiplayer (online/local/co-op) FPS/RTS game for all our systems. We have oodles of fighting and racing games but crap the bed when it comes to sports titles (nobody requests em').

"For those playing Mass Effect 2 on PC and are noticing extremely long load times - it's a bug, and there's a simple fix","Apparently there's a bug in how mass effect 2 interacts with dual core processors that can cause load times to increase tenfold. The solution is pretty straightforward:

After opening Mass Effect 2, alt tab back to windows and control alt delete to pull up the task manager.

Right click on the mass effect 2 process, select 'Set Affinity...'

Uncheck one of the two processors listed, in order to tell the process to use a single core of your processor. Hit OK.

Then, right click and select 'Set Affinity...' again. Reselect all the CPU cores, putting it back to the way it was when you first edited the affinity.

"Would reddit be interested in an EVE corp? We have a reddit WoW guild, we should use our numbers to our advantage in EVE!","Hey all -

A little about me to begin with:

I played EVE for a long time, I've got about 25mil SP, and have run a couple of mildly successful alliance campaigns. I've been feeling the itch to get back into the game, but the part of the game that I'm ""good"" at is corporation management and political positioning.

As those of you who play the game know, GoonSwarm was built on a similar principle: a group of players from another community website. I feel that if the EVE players of reddit got together, we could make something similarly powerful in a game where a close-knit community truly pays off.

If you'd like, I will start this corporation tonight. Here are my credentials:

- 25million SP.

- Seasoned Carrier Pilot (with a couple of carriers in tow).

- Seasoned in corporation management (I have run industrial and PVP corps)

- Have participated in alliance warfare on a leadership level (coordinated with a former alliance in attacking both BoB and GoonSwarm)

- Have run multiple POS's, and produced capital ships

- Know how to delegate and reward in a manner fitting to EVE.


I have a plan for our corp's initial couple of months. Naturally, we are not going to be able to jump directly into 0.0 and begin destroying everything in sight. First we will have a time period of decentralization while word spreads through *this* site regarding our exploits.

If this is something reddit would like to see, speak up. If I get a decent turnout in the next few hours, I'll create the guild tonight and we'll get this ball rolling. We already have a slight advantage over the reddit WoW guild in that we don't have to deal with multiple servers. Furthermore, we'll have a decent spread of all time zones so that when the time DOES come to start the pewpew, our territory will be easily defensible.

--------------------------------------

Edit: Since this is your corp just as much as it is mine, I need name suggestions.

---------------------------------------

Edit 2, FAQ: the following questions were brought up in the thread:

*What kind of corp are you looking to start?* - initially (for roughly the first month) we will be largely decentralized as we gather steam and members. During this time we will be able to use in game resources to organize how our leadership will work, and run a few odd things together. After the first couple of weeks, we'll begin congregating in a TBD system, and begin a mock territory grab operation. After this is solid, we will begin our 0.0 conquest with a single system, and expand from there accordingly.

*What are you going to set the tax rates at?* - I've found in the past that 5% is sufficient to take care of anything the corp may need to purchase for itself, and is lower than most corporations. If this is a problem, we can certainly address it.

*How are you going to punish asshats who get the corp wardeced by talking smack?* - Ideally this won't be a problem. After our initial calibration, we will move to 0.0 where wardecs mean nothing. Furthermore, being wardecced is fun if you're the biggest fish in the pond.

*What exactly does ""council run and go by the will of the site"" mean?* - In my experience, some people naturally fall into leadership positions in this game. Everyone has their strengths and EVE certainly brings them out. As our numbers grow, we will determine how many people we need in leadership positions to make corp-altering decisions (such as direction, strategy and whatnot) This is pretty far in the future, but people should be aware that this corp will not be run by me and me alone (down the road, I may not even take a leadership position)

-------------
Edit3: Headed home for the night. I'll be in and out of game a little tonight, my character is Fletcher Hammond if you want to drop me a line. Keep an eye on this thread through tomorrow as we figure out what the name of the corp shall be.

Hey there.  I've been thinking about innovation and game design.  How do you like this epic game idea?,"I was thinking outside today about my ""perfect game"" and my ADD brain imported a piece of randomness that I totally approved of.

As someone who defines a game by its level of immersion, I'm often let down by the attempts of new-gen games in capturing my attention.  I'm absolutely sure I'm not alone in this, and I think it would be fun to design a game in which the object was to alter the world around you to be more consistent with what the player decides is acceptably immersive.

I'm imagining a game that starts out with several incongruous art styles, battle systems, enemies, goals, etc... and lets the player use whatever method he feels most comfortable in to sort out the game world and customize it to his liking.  Don't like take-cover-to-heal?  Strengthen your skill in medpacks to give yourself an advantage in that area.  Annoyed by NPC's that act ""unrealistically""?  Forge a campaign to eliminate them through diplomacy or force.

The ability to alter the world around you in a game is something that's often hinted at and rarely applied.  I think it'd be incredible to base an entire game around utilizing game mechanics to shape the workings and population of a game.  Randomly-generated quests could make an ""endgame"" of sorts possible long after the player has eliminated that which does not suit his tastes.

I see the whole thing as slightly unfeasible, but I take inspiration from the mentality of the devteam behind SS2.  The ""we didn't know we couldn't do it, so we did it"" attitude appeals to me greatly.

Anyone else interested in this sort of thing?  Anyone want to chat about it?  The networking possibilities inherent in Reddit's structure completely blow my mind and I'd really like to meet some like-minded people.",gaming

Thinking of playing WoW again -- Should I or shouldn't I?,"I quit playing WoW about a year and a half ago, a few months before WotLK came out and I've been sober from it ever since.  Recently, however, I've really been feeling the urge to play again but I'm trying to make an informed, rational (versus impulsive) decision on the matter.  Can you help me, reddit?

My biggest concern is the time commitment. I'm a full-time undergraduate student, work/volunteer part time, and have a girlfriend I love spending time with. When I used to play, I had significant fewer responsibilities, so playing hours on end wasn't an issue.  I still play games on XBox and whatnot, but I've never been able to find a game that scratches the same itch that WoW did.  

Does anyone else here with significant time constraints play WoW and manage to have fun?  Can you really play WoW as a 'casual' player?  Since I doubt I'll be able to commit to any kind of raid schedule, is there any end-game content that I can participate in?  Aside from information I can find by reading patch notes, has anything really changed?  And most importantly, would you recommend coming back to WoW, or should I just steer clear and not run the risk of becoming hooked on it again?  Any sort of advice or perspective would really be appreciated, reddit!",gaming

I can't work out if either include weather effects, which would be significant factor in my decision. The level of editing and the ability to import free user-created add-ons is also a plus point. The expensive DLC for Railworks that appear on Steam isn't exactly attractive, but then DLC/expansions for sims are generally expensive as a rule, and I presume there is still plenty of user-created stuff. All the TS2009 content working with the out-of-the-box TS2010 is a big plus as well. I'm sure I've heard less than flattering things about some aspects of Railworks as well, but I can't find where I read that, so I'm not going to simply dismiss it out of hand.

A question about game DRM.,"Good morning/evening Reddit.  

I was wondering what your thoughts on DRM are when it comes to indie games...    

You see I run www.2point0studios.com and we have made 3 medium sized indie games for Xbox Live and we are currently thinking of getting into pc. (Thanks to the huge amount of interest from my previous post when I asked if you guys thought a pc version would be any good.)  

Anyway so we are going to try to get onto steam/impulse etc... But that may take a while and in the meantime we were thinking of having a PayPal based system where you can just download the game after purchasing it.  

We were thinking about going DRM free but we are not sure because then the game would be basically a fully portable exe that would work on any pc.  

What are your thoughts on indie DRM and are such things as a serial key too annoying to do any good? Would you rather we just release it as a DRM free exe? Would everyone just send it around to their friends then instead of buying a copy (We would still be happy if it got that popular)     

.  

TL:DR What are your thoughts on indie game DRM and how should indie games be sold.

"BF:BC2- If your in a squad, than play tactically or get out and go lone. jeez...","So I've been playing BF:BC2 pretty regularly for the past few days.  Overall the game is great, a huge breath of fresh air from the stale CoD run-and-gunning of late.  

But seriously, how hard is it to play tactically?  It ruins the game kinda.  For instance, just last night I was in a squad with 3 snipers perched all in the same spot.  I tried to be encouraging and get one to switch kits and rush a little with me (i like being medic) but none were having it.  I tried leaving the squad, but whenever i joined another, it just put me back in the same one.

and I hope that in the final version of the game the squad select screen has more options, like letting you look at all the squads and let you choose which one to join. (a kin to BF2 and BF2142)

*  Include features that were used in missions in freeroam, like gripping onto the top of vehicles, and perhaps the ability to leap from speeding car to another speeding car (So many possibilities in multiplayer!)

"Reddit, what program should I use to get started in making a 3D game? Need to know where to begin.","I know it's unrealistic, but I'm wanting to at least try to make a 3D game of my own. So, where can I start? What is the best way to accomplish this? The only game-building experience I've had is from building a lot of 2D games with GameMaker, but that's a different story and on an entirely different (and obviously much lower) level. So, what is the most optimal way to start building a 3D game, no matter how unrealistic/irrational it may be to attempt this independently? Thank you! 

Edit: I don't care about it looking good; I just want it to function, and improving graphics would be the last step. I don't expect to actually have a great end product, or even accomplish much at all; I just desire the experience of at least trying to build a 3D game of my own. If nothing else, I think this would be a very fun/educational experience.

Melee attacks: what is wrong with the FPS genre,"So yesterday I downloaded the demo for Bad Company 2. Hopped straight into a game and absolutely loved it. Guns, terrain, movement all very *very* realistic imo. After 10 minutes of sneaking around I was sold, was going to buy. However, then the knifing started.

Which leads me to my point.
How is it exceptable for a modern realistic shooter to still include one-hitter-quitter melee? I just don't get it, you're this highly trained combat tested soldier and yet you can't defend yourself from hand to hand attacks? Never mind that you just shot this guy 7 times with a 9mm he still can kill you instantly with one knife attack and run away to kill your friends. In the end it is just who can get the message to the server faster, .000001 seconds can separate the signals and you still lose. Unacceptable! 

I think the game mechanic that got melee the closest to right (by no means perfect) is the plasma sword in Halo. Two guys with swords attack each other within a quarter of a second and they just bounce off. How it should be with all bladed instruments in FPS. Also, just the basic melee in Halo is more reasonable. Sneak up on a guy and melee him in the back, instant kill. Run at a guy and hit him in the face, takes at least two hits.

Does anyone else feel like this?

"Hey Reddit, tried the Heavy Rain PS3 demo yet? Because it is without a doubt the most amazing demo I've ever tried.","Never before has a single demo left me as thrilled and exhilarated as when I tried this one. Sure it starts a bit slow and the voice acting doesn't necessarily meet the brilliant Uncharted 2 standards. Nevertheless, It was an amazing demo and if you've got a PS3 and a British PSN account (I checked on the American PS-Store, couldn't find it, it'll probably show up soon) then I urge you to download it!

"Okay, time for a general gaming poll...","So, I've been playing BioShock for the past week or so, having preordered BioShock 2 with 3 friends. I haven't played a lot of games yet, so when I started playing I started on medium, but found it too difficult. I then went down to easy and found it too easy. I encountered the same problem with difficulty differences in HL2 and, funnily enough, Guitar Hero and its related games. So, my question to you is, should game developers make more difficulty levels in order to lower the learning curve for a game? In my opinion, yes, since a game generally has more to it than just the gameplay. I like games with good stories, and the story is repetitive and sometimes hard to follow if you're constantly having to load a saved game or be revived. As far as Guitar Hero goes, starting a song over just blows. So, opinions, go!",gaming
Looking for decent low end games to play on my netbook while travelling.,"So I have a new Acer Aspire One netbook I purchased mostly for travelling, I have a decent gaming rig at home that plays any game I want fairly well, but I was thinking I could use some more stuff on it.

-160 gb HD
-1.6 ghz CPU
-1 gb DDR2 ram
-Intel onboard graphics (poop!)

For Those of You Who Like Starcraft and Settlers of Catan...,"My friend and I wanted to start a project involving the making of our own Settlers' board and we thought, ""Why not combine the awesome that is Starcraft and Settlers?"" 2 weeks later, with the artful use of Photoshop, an architecture studio, and the internet, we had finished our nerdiest project ever. I was really surprised by how well it actually came out.

Imgur Upload: 

Wood = Vespene (Green) Brick = Refined Mineral (Yellow) Sheep = Supply (Orange) Food = Mineral (Blue) Ore = Tech (Grey)

We took it a step further with the nerdy factor, too. You'll notice some new cards, which are a part of the new rules implemented in our optional expansion. We added a combat element to the game to give a full breadth of the RTS experience. Assault and Defense/Reinforcement cards merely add static +1 bonuses to the Attack stat and Defense stat. Safeguard is the Dev version of defense where you play it as a reactionary measure. Attack/Defense are different from Dev cards, have their own pile, and remain visible the whole game. You can sacrifice two Assault cards for a defense bonus that turn. You can also sacrifice 2 Defense cards for a road flip, where possession of any single road adjacent to your network is given to you. Combat is only allowed when your road links directly to another settlement, where you can either steal resources or vie for control over the settlement. The more roads that separate your nearest settlement from theirs, the more attrition there is to invade (flat decrease in attack power). Rise of Nations inspired us to develop this sphere of influence concept and it adds an interesting dynamic for those who get cut off by aggressively expanding players. Road flips now play a key factor in opening new paths for expansion, providing buffer between you and your enemies, removing that buffer between you and your victims, and seizing the Longest Road card from your rivals.

You can play the Greed card at the beginning of your turn, which allows you to throw 4 dice. The normal 2 dice are for everybody, but the person who played the card gets every permutation of the 4 dice rolled. It makes for a powerful endgame tactic, much like Monopoly.

The Apocalypse card is the obligatory nuke for any Starcraft game. It permanently turns one tile into a “desert” tile at random. You reroll the dice and pick which of the two tiles that number corresponds to. Good fun. You can thank Risk: God Storm for setting the precedent of game-breaking random stuff like that. We usually don’t play with this, though. Only for the lulz.

We’re still playtesting all this; we want the combat mechanic to be a viable answer to aggressive expansion, so we can see a larger variety of strategy. The only issue is that combat is very resource draining, so games end up taking an extra hour to complete. We’ve yet to find a good way to accelerate resource acquisition in a fitting way to compensate. We have patience, though! I heard the maker of Settlers sat his family down to play it everyday for 2 years before he perfected the formula.

We made a clay Kerrigan to be the bandit, too! (",gaming
"*Spoiler* What WOULD have made Mass Effect 2 a really, really great Game.","*Spoileralert* Mass Effect 2 has really great Missions all the way through, but unfortunately it lacks a real main storyline. Why the Geth did they cut the alliance and the council nearly completely? I always waited to be betrayed by Cerberus, as it was implied all the time in my eyes, but it just never happens. In my opinion, it really should have gone in the way, that the player would have to decide between alliance and cerberus and experience two different major Endgames from that point on. Also why didnt they develop a real cool villain ala Darth Vader, Joker oder Eric Cartman. The nameless General or the Illusive Man stay a bit pale after all. And at last, there should have been more interesting sidemissions on random planets, these handmade 15-minute-missions were really well meant, but as said just well meant. What do you think?

[SPOILERS] What I'd like to see in ME3,"Some serious spoilers lie ahead, so you've been warned.

I'd like to see a ME3 where the main plot line is about choosing between fully co-operating with Cerebus to make humans the most powerful species in the universe or betraying TIM and re-joining with the Alliance to save all civilizations in the galaxy but maybe not fully defeating the reapers.  It would go something like this:

 -  Since you now know the Reapers are coming you need to convince all the races that the threat is real and gather a defense.
 -  If you're working with Cerebus you need to trick the non human races into putting themselves at risk when the reapers first attack.  Cerebus will be holding back for an ambush once the non human races have had their asses mostly kicked.
 -  If you're working with the alliance you need to honestly convince the other races to help in a preemptive stike that will force the reapers to retreat.  You will also have to take down Cerebus.
 -  If you saved the Collector ship in ME2 and are working with Cerebus you will have the ability to completely destroy the Reapers when you ambush them.  After that humans take over the universe using reaper technology.",gaming
What is/was your biggest gaming disappointment?,"I was just looking up a bit of info on Final Fantasy XIII for the first time and found out that Square stripped out all towns, sidequests, and there are minimal NPCs. Their bullshit argument was that the systems couldn't handle it. One review said there are only a little over 20 named characters. They basically put out a dungeon crawler and called it Final Fantasy. Square has been falling for years and I'm now done. I still prefer JRPGs to WRPGs (I know, blasphemy here) but not if Square is involved in almost any way.

5 least favorite games of all time and why?,"Try to avoid the obvious.  I really enjoy reading this sort of thing.

COD4:

I'm not sure what it is about this game.  I was thrilled to try it, and I finally got my hands on it about a year after it came out.  I remember watching the opening sequence and having all immersion destroyed by my car's rear view mirror (featured prominently about 2"" away from your face) display a pixelated, static image of a moving character.

As someone that grew up on tribes and day of defeat, the gameplay was mind-blowingly simplistic and unrefined.  The ""shoot brown people until they die"" gameplay mechanic wore itself out before half of the campaign was completed.  It came off as a fascism simulator.  That it was so popular with such shitty gameplay really made me question the times.

Oh, and:

""X"" hit indicator wallhacks.
Horrible spawning system.

It seemed like the kind of game that should come in an adolescent happy meal.

Counterstrike:

I loved tribes.  I think that's why I hated Counterstrike as much as I did.

Sure it takes skill.  Throwing screwdrivers into the air and having them fall tip-first into the opening of your erect penis takes skill too.  That doesn't make it fun to do or watch.

WoW:

Makes the list because my friends will BUY ME ACCOUNTS just to get me to play.  I don't like any of the (now homogenized) classes.

I struggle to think of anything more depressing than consumer culture bottled up and prescribed to a population that thinks it could do anything to improve their lives in any way.  I just got off work, so I think I'll go to my second job so I can buy that new X with experience or gold and then show it off in the town square until I see a Y that outclasses my X.  Then I'll work for that.

The gameplay is so measured and procedural that it's nonexistent.  Rogues are a ridiculously annoying class that throw balance out of whack and force incredibly unintuitive (and unimaginative) balancing measures so that a portion of the population can get the kicks that come with being an invisible, sadistic asshole.

70% of players quit before they hit level 10 because 70% of players realize that the core gameplay from that point on will not CHANGE.

Diablo 2:

Makes the list because my friends will BUY ME ACCOUNTS just to get me to play.  I don't like any of the classes.  I don't care about randomly-generated gear.  I don't find PVP in D2 interesting when starcraft does it better on an exponentially-larger scale.

I have absolutely no idea how a game this one-dimensional and repetitive is such a classic, but I'd bet my kidneys that it has something to do with me not playing it until 4 years after it debuted.

Oblivion:

I'm an AI freak.  I lurked the Elder Scrolls site years before Oblivion hit, eating up every ounce of hype they cared to feed me about the new Radiant AI system.  ""AI will need to eat and satiate that need by hunting deer if no food is available...""

It was bullshit.  All of it.  Oblivion was Morrowind lite with a physics tech demo attached.  It just didn't feel like a role playing game anymore.

The thief guild quests were fun from an action game standpoint, though.",gaming
Am I the only one over 12 who plays Castle Crashers?,I'm 27 and I absolutely loved this game for it's art design and simple combat structure.  I hate it that I can't play online without being stuck with literally all twelve and thirteen year olds aside from those guys who did the Level 256 cheat.  Nobody wants to play insane mode or even go through the game as much as use glitches to level up.  What's the point of leveling up if you never play through the game?,gaming
Gamers are what's killing video games (you too reddit),"I was reading the topic about ""button-mashing"" and it really started to make me realize what wusses gamers are becoming. The worst part is  it's not just casual gamers, it's the hardcore too (I'd generally consider r/gaming to be hardcore gamers). 

There were people crying about button-mashing and ""quick time events"". Really reddit? Button mashing may be silly when used improperly, but it can also be an important tool. Games are fun the more skills you need to beat it. If a game only requires accuracy, or only requires reflexes, then it's not usually going to be fun for very long. Button mashing can be an interesting test of endurance and thumb/finger speed for gamers. I loved the ability to power up summons in Final Fantasy 8 by using the button mashing skills I had developed from Mario Party and my NES days.

What really blew me away were the other complaints though. Quick time events? REALLY? When these first came out they were hailed as a triumph of gaming (Shenmue is the first game I remember playing that had them). I agree that some games can be annoying with QTEs, but generally I think it adds a layer of interactivity to the cutscenes that is refreshing and keeps you on your toes. The QTEs in Shenmue, Resident Evil and Kingdom Hearts are terrific. If you reflexes are too slow to handle it, then get better.

Complaints like this are why games are getting so damn EASY lately. Gamers bitch and moan if a game is even slightly difficult. Anyone remember Devil May Cry 3 getting criticized for being ""too difficult""? It wasn't even that hard compared to games like Ninja Gaiden or Super Mario Bros 2 (Japan version). People were mad that you had to restart a stage when you died. Boo-hoo. 

Between endless checkpoints in action-adventure games, regeneration in FPS games, rewinds in racing games, and the general decrease in difficulty overall (NES games on normal were generally as difficult as a modern game on hard/very hard), I have very little urge to play modern games. I mean does anyone actually want to have any skill in the games they play, or do they just like to look at the pretty pictures?

I think what games need to do is allow you to save (people need to be able to play in more than one sitting) but give you 3-5 continues depending on the game. After you use up your continues it deletes your save. In fact, didn't they do that in Sonic 3? Why does every game ever made nowadays have infinite continues and endless checkpoints? You don't even have to be good at the game to beat it, you just have to be able to drag yourself from checkpoint to checkpoint.

I hope in a generation or two of consoles they just give gamers what they really want. Unlimited health in every game and in racing games the cars will drive for you. Seems like the logical end game to me.

I'm trying to remember a game Reddit,"It's from a long time ago, probably around a decade. It was a race game and you had to race around the world, and I think you started in Europe. The opening cutscene was a bar and the person who was in charge of a race came in and was all like ""You're all bored, let's race"". There were cards that did functions as well. There was a money aspect too.

Miscellaneous details:
Some of the cards: move 1 space, move 2 spaces, 3, 4 etc. reduce debt to zero, 'platinum'
You drove around on land and when your character went over water they turned into a plane.

"For anyone still playing the AvP demo, here's what I've learned.","When I first tried it, I was really disappointed with the alien's slow movement speed and weak jumping distance. As it turns out, there's a way to fix that!

The ""Sprint"" key (default: Q) is incredibly powerful for the Alien. You get a burst of immense speed, with a very short cooldown.

Likewise, holding the ""Focus"" key (default: left shift) gives you a jumping crosshair wherever you're looking. Press jump (Space) to jump to that point! You can jump huge distances this way.

These commands also work for the Predator, incidentally, though they're both less powerful.

Other unobvious features:

For the Alien, the right mouse button is a tail attack. This has a surprisingly long range, and if it hits, you get a momentary chance to grab your opponent and do a cutscene-kill... but it's a trap! Don't do it. The tail attack does so much damage anyway, you can finish them off with one claw attack. (Against Marines, at least.)

Pressing the left and right mouse button at the same time is a ""block"" move. I haven't managed to work out when's a good time to do it - seems like you're almost always better off just attacking.

The predator's weapons are lying around the level, just like the marine's, but you can't see them until you're right next to them. Look for little red icons.

Open questions: I've occasionally seen predators block a grab move, and counterattack. Anyone know how that's done?

For instance. The best games for me were either Fallout 3, or Saint's Row 2. FO3 featured amazing graphics and appealed to my pack-rat/ Columbus side, and gave me so much to explore and find and do, that i logged over 400 hours into the game without beating it. And that to me says something impressive. Still i go back to it to play around and have fun, because as Yahtzee said, seeing mutilated body parts fly away in slow motion never gets old... or something like that. 

SR2 on the other hand is just balls out fun. No rules, or boundaries, it encourages you to play the way you want to, with no interruptions or moral barometer. To me it is exactly what a game should be, fun.

These were just to examples, and i am looking forward to hearing about other games both innovative and fun.",gaming

Hi R/Gaming.  I think I might have an idea.  Anyone wanna correct me please.,"So, I might smoke too much green.  And I apologize for my incoherence, I just got back from the bar.  But I think I stumbled on something brilliant.  Parallax virtual reality doesn't really work.  It'll only sort of tricks the brain into perceiving depth.  Johnny Cheung Lee's wiimote projects are the genesis for this concept.  

My idea is to add another level of depth and realism to any 3rd person or 3/4 view game.  If the game knows where the player's head is then it can calculate depth of field.  The trees in the background move more slowly than the trees in the foreground.  The slight head-movements of the player is all that is required to add the illusion that the screen is merely a window into the realm. 
This concept could be retrofit to any game that'd care to use it.  

I'm probably wrong.  But I think I'm right.  Any ideas?  I can clarify once I sober up.

Bed.  Will reply in the morning.  :)",gaming
Just finished BioShock 2... (possible spoilers!),"I thought the plot had potential but ultimately didn't deliver like the first game. It suffered from weak story writing, and I found the ending pretty dissatisfying. It's hard to top BioShock I guess. Also, the multiplayer is unplayable for me (on PC). I haven't found a game that doesn't lag.

What did you guys think?",gaming
"Hey Gaming/r/, What is your favorite/best control scheme? [PC]","I was thinking that Mass Effect had the closest to what suits me. Camera controls were good, free mouse pointer. With the exception of no 1st person view, I'd say it was almost perfect.

Convince me to (not?) buy Mount and Blade.,"As with most weekend deals, the time investment is exponentially higher than the monetary one.  So do I need to play this?  It seems like the type of game with a cult fanbase that wants to convert some skeptics.

I'm curious; why would one not like Steam?,"I mean I've had it for about 4 years now and only own two games (TF2 and CS1.6) but haven't had any issues with it. I usually do buy my games from a store until recently I've weighed the options of Steam to be a very beneficial system. 

However, one thing that has been sticking in my mind is there has to be some downsides. So I'm asking you /r/gaming:

What downsides to steam have you come across or justify a hate for the digital distribution platform?",gaming
So I bought a spare xbox 360 Arcade on a Black Friday deal...,"At the time I was thinking I could use it in a spare bedroom, and at $100 it was a deal too good to pass up.  But now that I factor in the cost of the wifi adapter and a hard drive its just not worth it to have a 360 available as a backup in case the big TV is being used.  Does reddit have any suggestions for how I can get at least my money back out of this?  I don't think I'll have much luck with Craigslist, as my local market is saturated with sellers.  I'm curious to know how much GameStop would offer...but I'd rather avoid dealing with their shenanigans if at all possible. Any suggestions?",gaming
My Friend thinks his new rig is better than mine. I need you guys to prove him wrong.,"No matter how much proof I show him on my own means he just ignores it. But if he saw a bunch of redditer comments saying so, he might just come to his sences. So here are the specs:

Mine:
i5 750 Quadcore 2.66 ghz cpu 8mb cache
BFG GeForce gtx 260 1024mb gpu
4gb of ddr3 1600

His:
i3 540 dual core 3.06 ghz cpu 4mb cache
EVGA GeForce 9500 1gb gpu
4gb of ddr3 1333

This may look ridiculous but he really truly thinks his is better and that just gets on my nerves.

"Reddit-comment-chess group tournament concept: Let's all play a giant, continuous game of Unicode chess in the comments to this post. Details inside...","I'm curious to see how this will turn out, and if anyone is even interested. I've been curious to see how a board game could work on reddit, and this is a first step. Here's the game board, which you can copy/paste into your replies to comments, rearranging the pieces to match the previous state, plus the change for your move:

    ┌|─|─|─|─|─|─|─|─|┐
    -|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
    │|♜|♞|♝|♛|♚|♝|♞|♜|│
    │|♟|♟|♟|♟|♟|♟|♟|♟|│
    │| | | | | | | | |│
    │| | | | | | | | |│
    │| | | | | | | | |│
    │| | | | | | | | |│
    │|♙|♙|♙|♙|♙|♙|♙|♙|│
    │|♖|♘|♗|♕|♔|♗|♘|♖|│
    └|─|─|─|─|─|─|─|─|┘

Reddit's new Discount table syntax will handle turning it into a graphical board, like this:

┌|─|─|─|─|─|─|─|─|┐
-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-
│|♜|♞|♝|♛|♚|♝|♞|♜|│
│|♟|♟|♟|♟|♟|♟|♟|♟|│
│| | | | | | | | |│
│| | | | | | | | |│
│| | | | | | | | |│
│| | | | | | | | |│
│|♙|♙|♙|♙|♙|♙|♙|♙|│
│|♖|♘|♗|♕|♔|♗|♘|♖|│
└|─|─|─|─|─|─|─|─|┘

The second row of dashes and pipes is what triggers the table markdown, and the extra pad of cells framing the outside is both for decoration, and to hold height on the entirely empty rows, especially at the beginning, otherwise they collapse.

**To play:**

Do what I said in the first paragraph, copying the first board graphic above in its entirety, and moving the pieces around to match whatever previous state you're starting from with the addition of your move. Here's the part I'm interested in: **Anyone can reply to any board state** with a new state, but no one is guaranteed to reply to any in particular, so any game may stall out.

We should get a huge branching of possible game states as we go, collapsing Chess' wave function along the way. Of course, you can look for a particular username to reply to your last state to keep a game going between two people, but anyone is free to fork any game at any point, creating a new instance of the outcome of that game from that point by simply replying to it with a next move.

I think text comments embedded alongside gameplay (questions to the players, e.g.) will be alright, though they'll space out the moves a bit. Again, as I said, I just want to see what it looks like to watch games unfold in this way on reddit.",gaming
Why do people think that Battlefield: Bad Company 2 will be what MW2 should have been?,"Let's not forget that EA was the spearheader in ""pay more to win"" business strategies, especially in the Battlefield series, where players would buy add-ons to get overpowered weapons (as we all know EA tried to pull the same crap again in BC1). EA's rep for ripping people off has always been known, so why are we ignoring that right now?

 * This Ditto must always be the first in your party, and the only one to fight.

 * You may have another in your party, but that Pokemon may not fight. It is only for HMs. (I may have to make an exception to this rule for the fishermen you encounter who only have Magikarp. It would be this

Thanks Reddit for recommending Mass Effect.  I just completed it after about 25 hours of game play.,"Awesome, just awesome.  Can't remember when I've enjoyed a game so much.  And for $19.99 on steam... it makes Blu Ray disc prices seem like highway robbery.

Going to wait a little bit before diving into the sequel.  I have been doing a lot of walking around and talking to people!

If I had one complaint, I'd agree with the Escapist and say the game does ""punish"" you a bit for not listening to every character's life story.  I found that I had to set aside hours at at time to play, since just burning through it seemed like not the best way to play it.

"Are there any ""rpg-like"" empire-building strategy games?","I love strategy games. Classic RTS's like Starcraft or Age of Kings and turn-based like Civ or Master of Orion. But one of the disappointing aspects of strategy games is it never feels like it's building up towards some long-term accomplishment, like you get with RPG's.

After hours and hours of play in RPGs, you end up with a sort of unique character that you built up and customized and can be... kind of proud of. The gameplay of strategies are almost akin to shooters - there's a nice story-driven campaign that everyone plays through, and after that the gameplay options are just a bunch of one-off game/battles. At the end of hours and hours, all you really have to show for it is maybe a Win-Loss record. Or even for more ""epic"" games like Civilization, you just reach an endgame where you own all the territory and researched all the tech and there's just nothing more to play.

It would seem like the strategy genre would be easily adaptable to an RPG-type game, however. You have individual battles yes, but it's all gradually building up a larger empire as well. Is there any type of game like this?",gaming

What was your Mass Effect 2 ending? [Spoilers],"Mine ended in basically a blood bath. I didn't upgrade the ship or really to many weapons at all. Everyone died except Miranda, Mordin, Tali, Grunt, and myself. 

Jack died when something came through engineering and killed her. Same with Garrus.

I chose Jacob to go through the vents, basically because I figured he'd die and I didn't like him very much. So he got the door open let us through then died when he couldn't get it shut again.

Samara was leading the 2nd team and took a shot to the stomach after that.

How important your K/D ratio is to you? Victories/losses? General performance in online games?,"Dear Reddit, these past couple of days I been playing Bad Company 2 and I noticed that I am no longer having fun anymore. I am taking it too seriously. I get really mad if my team is losing and is completely oblivious to it - like, everyone would go on the front lines while a single enemy squad is taking out the control points, every single one of them, with just ONE squad. No one ever defends anymore, no one ever plays MEDIC anymore, everyone just goes support and rushes to the front to spam the nades for a couple of seconds before they get wiped out by a coordinated attack of the enemy team.

I rage and it causes me to do stupid shit, like singlehandedly trying to take out a camping enemy squad: I REALLY MUST SHOW THEM WHO'S THE BOSS!

"Hey Reddit, how do video games positively impact other areas of life?","My son played The Godfather for Wii pretty much nonstop during the last week of summer. He'd played it for 53 hours, so it was essentially his full time job, plus a little overtime. When he was done he went to the piano and picked out the notes to the theme. A few months and lots of practice later he performed the song on stage.

Does anyone else miss the large PC games boxes from the 90's?,"I miss those PC game boxes. I miss the quality of video games products in general during the 90's. I loved getting a new PC game and the box was half the size of a pizza box. It was covered in pictures, there was a flap on the front that opened for more pictures. You would then proceed to open the box to find an instruction manual that would rival the length of a Webster's dictionary. Digging further into the box, you would find a cloth map, a booklet with future releases by the developer, and sometimes a music CD. At the very bottom of the box, held in place by 2 cardboard flaps, would be a jewel CD case that contained your game.

Don't get me wrong, I love the Steam distribution, but the quality of product you received when purchasing a game in the 90's was unparalleled.",gaming

When they were released, the genres that these games occupied weren't necessarily defined yet, and it created an extremely new and immersive experience.

My girlfriend is a genius.,"Yesterday, me and my girlfriend were on a long road trip. My mom called, noting that her and my girlfriend needed to exchange Lost theories.

""Lost sucks,"" I pointed out. ""How could you possibly want to invest so much time into that show? The payoff's never going to be worth it.""

After a while we came to the topic of video games and she noted she had never played the Metal Gear series. ""Explain it to me,"" she said. ""We've got the time.""

So I did, going in chronological order, starting with Metal Gear Solid 3, explaining how Snake is a clone of Big Boss, who was mentored by the Boss, how the Metal Gears are Cold War-invented mechs designed to carry nuclear weapons, and how Snake had to take down Big Boss in Outer Heaven and then retired to Alaska, but then was rehired by the government to deal with a new Metal Gear and discovered that his twin-clone-brother Liquid was there as well. Then I went on to detail the second game, explaining how Snake was a false protagonist, the revelation that Solidus was a third clone brother (making them triplets) and that actually by the end of the game the vast majority of it proved to be a virtual reality simulation to train people to be like Solid Snake. I was just starting to explain Metal Gear Solid 4 when she stopped me.

I know there are a lot of post similar to this, but I would greatly appreciate some help with my specific situation.  I am an avid RPG fan and would love to share my passion with my girlfriend, but I need to get her into the idea of video games first.

Disney (I can't stress enough how much this would help, you should see our apartment)

Social - whether its just me or multiple people

Visually appealing

Advice needed: What are some good 2-player multiplayer games for the PC that would be accessible to my 65 year old dad?  See text for more info.,"After holding out for years, I finally got a HDTV.  My father is so excited about the TV that he wants to play PC games on it with me now.

I think it's a great idea and a fun way to spend some time chilling with my dad, but I think that most games aren't suited for multiplayer, and those that are may be too difficult for him.

In the past, I have tried to get him into some racing games because he likes cars so much, but he was unable to get control over the car and spends most of his time ramming into walls.

I was thinking that one of the earlier Need for Speed games would be better since the cars drive and handle much slower.  I was also thinking about perhaps Worms Armageddon where reflexes aren't a determining factor in winning.

What would be some other good PC games that you could recommend?

Is anyone else bothered by this in Bioshock 2?,"First, let me say that I was very impressed with the original, and the second one is pretty entertaining and despite the following I'd still recommend it. However:


The big difference from the first one is that you play as a Big Daddy. Awesome right? Well, kind of. I'm playing on hard difficulty, but hard difficulty or not, you are a Big Daddy, a big hulking brute in a metal diving suit. Yet playing through the first few levels you lose health just as easily as you did in the beginning of the first game. A splicer with a pipe hitting you over the head should not take away 20% of your health, regardless of difficulty. A splicer across the room can devastate you with a pistol. Going 1v1 with a Big Daddy requires plenty of ammo and medkits, because while your rivet gun makes almost unnoticeable changes in his health, HIS rivet gun is a beast that will make you churn through medkits like crazy (of course when you pick it up it uses the same ammo and your gun gets no stronger).  I know you're an older model Big Daddy, but a massive metal diving suit is a massive metal diving suit. I remember seeing splicers get annihilated in the first one when provoking a Big daddy. In B2, if more than two splicers show up with guns you literally have to run for cover. WTF? I know its hard difficulty for a reason, but there are ways of making the game harder that make sense and ways that don't. Why not make healing kits much more infrequent or scarce special Big daddy repair stations in exchange for true Big Daddy health.  COME ON!


**edit**: I am not saying it shouldn't be hard. I am saying that there should be a better way to make it difficult that doesn't rely on completely overlooking game ideas (ie, that a Big Daddy is one. )

tl;dr - You are too squishy starting off in bioshock 2.",gaming
Was I the only one who thought the story to Mass Effect 2 was terrible? *spoilers*,"Don't get me wrong, the gameplay (especially when compared to the first one) was great and really fun. It's the story that got me. My favorite thing about the first game was the story. But we're at the same place story-wise at the end of ME2 that we were at the end of 1. Nothing that major changed, other than a new team/ship. Also, the formulaic companion storylines were disappointing. Ok,  a crew member wants to talk to me. Hmmm I wonder if it's a quest to raise their loyalty and get a new outfit. Even the Reapers, who, after the first game, I thought were the coolest and most interesting sci-fi villians in a long while, were a letdown. Why were they working with the Collectors to build a human reaper? None of that seemed to have been explained. Maybe I missed something? The Omega relay to the center of the galaxy was also a huge letdown. Ok, lots of debris, a red hue everywhere, and one alien mothership. What is the big deal? A large Citadel fleet couldn't handle that? Bioware really couldn't make THE CENTER OF THE GALAXY more awesome?

I really hope ME3's story blows me away and, unlike 2, maybe makes me ponder my choices at times. Maybe something like being able to destroy all of the Reapers but having to kill off most of the human race at the same time. You know, actual tough choices like whether to save the Council in the first one. I'm just rambling, but I'd really love to hear what others enjoyed so much about the game's story.

EDIT: Here's where I was expecting the story to go when I started it. You spend the game helping the Illusive Man fight the Collectors. Near the end of the game, you realize that Cerebrus is actually working with the Reapers to defeat the other Council races in exchange for protection, and you have to choose whether to keep helping them and protect the humans or not. But nope, none of that happened. Instead, a giant baby-reaper was being built, which I guess is kind of a big deal, but there seemed to be hundreds of them at the end anyways.

EDIT 2: This review of the story seems to bring up a lot of issues I had with it.:
&gt; Okay, so it’s a Reaper… somehow. What is the utility of a kilometer-tall robotic space-faring biped? Walk around in space? Punch spaceships? Bite stuff? Embarrass the enemy with its massive space genitalia? This is the OPPOSITE of what a machine race would do. This is adding inefficient organic cruft to a machine.",gaming

Does anyone else think that it is a shame that good game series like Mass Effect 2 are overshadowed by cookie-cutter shooters like Call of Duty and Halo?,"Games like Mass Effect have really good stories that drive the game. The Mass Effect series is definitely my favorite because it has a really good underlying story that unfolds and has a massive amount of background information, and utilizes characterization well enough to make you care about what happens to your allies (if you replayed the suicide mission to make sure a person didn't die, then you'll know what I mean). It also has a lot of choices that can impact the endgame and it really makes the game personal. Though I often hear my friends lauding Halo and Call of Duty, sure they are fun, but the stories aren't really fleshed out (disregarding Halo novels) and there is no characterization or deep thought-provoking plot, and yet games like these sell because every teenager needs to get that fps fix. the only thing that sells those games are their multiplayer matches, which is fine, but it doesn't help advance video games as a medium for good story telling.

Ending 1: (Save sisters, spare at least 1 person) Sunny sky, very uplifting, Lamb lives. Eleanor is happy

Ending 2: (Save sisters, kill everyone) dark sky, lamb is not alive, Eleanor seems very sad, as if you gave up on her.

Ending 3: (Kill sisters, Save everyone) dark sky, Eleanor sounds evil, lamb lives.

Ending 4: (kill sisters, kill people) dark sky, Eleanor sound evil..er? lamb dies. 

Sorry the differences between the last two weren't as noticeable to me.

Ending 2 is my favorite. Though I got ending 1 on my first play through.

Best part of my rig to upgrade for games?,"Hey guys, trying to tap into the hivemind here...

I have a few year old machine and i love my games, i'd like to squeeze a bit more life out of him with one more upgrade but i think i've hit the limit.

My Gfx, Chip and RAM are:

3.2GHz P4 800MHz FSB Socket 478

2Gb PC3200 3.3.3.8

Radeon x1650 512MB AGP

I'm a big CS source player aswell as Left4Dead

I can play small Supreme commander battles ok but any scale and Dex dies.

I feel trapped as i'm socket 478 and AGP, so if i change the board i have to change everything, but my board wont take more ram....

I'm tempted by some of the AGP radeon HD's but have no way of knowing wether i'll see any improvement...

There is a major problem with the concept of DLC and downloadable games on consoles,"Now that people are saying that downloadable games are the way of the future for consoles, I've come to realize a major problem.

Look at the NES. It's over 20 years old, and it can still play the same old games. You can still buy games from other people, and some people still make new games for it. Its legacy continues despite its age.

Now, what about the three current gen consoles? The Xbox 360, Wii, and PS3 have downloadable games and downloadable content for them. This looks good now, the games are cheaper, you don't have to go to the store to buy them, etc., but the problem is quite apparent. 

20 years from now, when all of the servers are gone, how are we going to be able to access these downloadable games and content? Are people going to trade around the actual consoles just to get the opportunity to play Mega Man 9? Are these games going to become a rarity that you can only play on a select few consoles of the people who bought them when the servers were still up?",gaming
Was I the only one who loved Freelancer?,"The voice acting may have been a bit cheesy, but hey, it had 90210's Steve Sanders! OK, that notwithstanding...

I loved both the exciting moments of being dropped in on by pirates or raiders, and the long stretches of ""holy shit this thing I'm going to is far away and it's taking forever!"" I loved hunting for wrecks. I loved flying into suns just to see if I could. I loved sneaking past patrols to get to jumpgates. I loved how all the systems, planets, asteroid fields, etc, were named after Earth cities/countries/locations/etc. I loved navigating radioactive areas.

I seriously loved this game. Still haven't found anything like it. Think I'll go install it again tonight and have some fun.

"Just beat Borderlands solo, thoughts... (kinda long)","*spoilers*

First off, yeah the ending and the last Boss were a joke. I agree with anyone who has said this as it's pretty much true. I mean the whole point of the game is finding the vault and the game ends with a claptrap joke? lame. However, the journey up until that point made this game the best of '09 imo. I know this game has been gettin hated on a lot lately, (I usually agree with most of what yahtzee says) but here's why I think it's the best game of '09:

A lot of critics point out that the story is pretty thin, The AI is dumb, and the gameplay gets repetitive. Allow me to address these points first off.

Yeah the story is pretty thin, but I would argue that the detailed environments make up for this. I can't remember how many times a played a normal FPS and quit after an hour or two because I just didn't give a shit. The environments were bland, the characters, repetitive, and the story was cookie-cutter derivative. But Borderlands environments, while admittedly similar in tone,(It's all desert wasteland) are laid out well, beautifully detailed and intricate, with plenty of side paths and secrets to find.  Also the stylized graphics kept me wanting to see just what the next zone looked like, and compelled me to explore almost everything.

I've read people saying the AI is dumb, or that you're essentially fighting different skins of the same enemy over and over. This partially true, I think. The AI is definitely not too bright, but I have noticed, especially in the later levels, that some monsters at least minimally try and flank. but I would say that visceral gameplay makes up for this shortcoming. What do I mean visceral? The satisfaction you get from blowing ants apart into a blue goo, or blowing a badass psycho' head off with a detonating sniper. Killing enemies and combat in general is fun. Combine this with the variety and power of the weapons and I think this makes up somewhat for brick-dumb AI. I don't think the difficulty in this game was supposed to lie in individual baddies, I think it lies in numbers. And I had plenty of fun mowing down fields of badguys with my caustic shotgun, and watching them disintegrate. But the detailed weapons, upgrades, and just loot in general kept me coming back for more.

As for repetitive gameplay, I can see the point many people have. Your essentially touring different environments and blowing away wave after wave of dumb enemies. But as for repetitive, I think it really depends on your perspective while playing the game. I never really looked at the game as a hardcore RPG, nor did I take it too seriously, so I was never expecting a deep story. In just took it for what it was: a fun action game that had lots of cool weapons, a bit of statistical depth, and style.

But style is what really kept me playing through this game, and it makes up for a lot of it's shortcomings. The art direction, tone, and overall coolness of the graphics, environment, and characters in general kept me playing. So take that for what it's worth, I'm just another asshole with an opinion...but my opinion is that this is the best game of '09.",gaming

Is it morally/ethically wrong to pirate video games when companies punish paying customers with highly restrictive DRM?,"In the last few years I have given up downloading movies, music, and video games for a few reasons:

* Services like Netflix/Steam provide great services at great prices.
* I graduated college and I have a job that gives me more than enough money to make these purchases.
* My career as a software engineer gave me perspective of the work that goes into making a product.

With the recent news of Ubisoft's new highly restrictive DRM, I question the ethical stance I have taken in recent years against pirating video games. I feel that I should not be punished for buying a game. I am not sure if this means I will just stop buying any video game with restrictive DRM or if I will start pirating these games after I purchase them to ensure I can enjoy the experience until the publisher releases a patch to remove said DRM.

What do you think Reddit? Where do you stand on the issue?



Edit: I highly doubt I will actually pirate any games, I am just frustrated with the hoops I have had to jump through to play games I have purchased. When I pirated games, I just had to copy over a cracked executable file, whereas with games I buy I have to have Punkbuster, GFWL, Securom, and a dozen other utilities running on my system just to play a game.


Edit 2: It seems the vast majority of you believe it is ethically wrong to pirate a game you did not pay for, but what about if I purchased the game and chose to pirate a DRM-free version? Or if I purchased the game and remove the DRM myself? The first situation is illegal and the 2nd depends on the EULA or ToS of the product.",gaming

Battlefield: Bad Company 2 thoughts and questions.,"So yesterday i bought Battlefield: Bad Company 2 for the PC and have been playing the beta quite a bit. First off id like to mention that it took me about 3 games to get out of my run-and-gun MW2 style of play. BC2 is DEFINITELY not MW2 and the style of play is totally different. Thats not a bad thing, in fact i find it rather refreshing. The medic is by far my favorite class so far and i find it the most satisfying class although it seems like i am the only person in the games to actually be reviving people. 

I realize that this is just a beta, but it seems really buggy. Also, my games seem to crash a lot or i lose connection to the EA online thing. Does this happen to anybody else on the PC version? Could it be because i dont have the best internet access or the best computer? Does anybody know exactly what they will be changing from the beta when the game releases? I know there will be more maps and gametypes, but will there be more classes/weapons/equiptment? It wouldnt be a problem if there isnt due to the customization of the classes, just curious.

This is my first Battlefield game, and i am very excited for the release of the full game. Too bad my computer is only OK and i wont be able to play the game on high settings in all of its glory.

"Ranting, or, How MW2 has killed my BF""BC2 demo experience.","To the dipshits who've been on the Bad Company 2 demo lately,
 
I just want to say, I HATE YOU. For the past two days, I've joined games that have ended in less than 20 minutes, simply because of this key little fact, PEOPLE RUN HEADFIRST INTO THE BATTLE, they die, rinse and repeat. I watched as a squad of 4 recon units ran PAST the objective, up into a building where they proceeded to knife one guy, then get blown the fuck up by an RPG. The best part? This squad did the exact same thing OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

**Here is a few tips for you.**

1.) If you're a medic, HEAL ME WHEN I'M BLEEDING OUT RIGHT INFRONT OF YOU! You're a medic, as in, YOU KEEP SOLDIERS ALIVE. Those chest paddles? They aren't so you can numb your hands a whack it off in a corner somewhere, they are so you can bring my ass back to life and I can hopefully, return the favor by keeping you alive.

2.) RECON, yes you have a bolt action rifle, and yes it has a scope. BUT YOU HAVE MORE TO DO THAN THAT! the c4, for instance, BLOWS SHIT UP, reeeeaaalll good like. try it on a vehicle, you may be suprised. Oh and another thing, for the snipers who have tried to out shoot me and failed horribly, AIM ABOVE THEM! at the distance some of you try and shoot, putting the + over my head will probably just piss me off and give away your position. Gravity, its crazy, but it happens. 

3.) Engineers, this is becoming one of my favorite classes, but come on guys. If you're rolling deep with a T-90, and the driver parks it somewhere to light some bitches up, at least give the guy a few courtesy repairs? Having to position, and fire a tank onto enemy soldiers is hard enough when I have to jump out and fix it on my own, more so when engineers flood past me, rpg's in hand to attempt some sort of failed rocket barrage.

4.) Headsets, seriously? In the short time I've been on, I had one squad that used them. I was a bit puzzled, why squads wouldn't attempt to communicate with each other. After all, we are (or at least I am) trying to keep the rest of my guys alive as best I can. Well fast forward a few matches, and I know why people don't use them. The majority that do, constantly bitch and moan that the other team is cheap because ""DAT GUY DIDN'T KNOW I WUZ THUR! HE CHEATED!'' Yeah, he cheated, because your the only thing in a gillie suit standing on top of the gray concrete roof of a building. Oh, and preteen boy, NO I DO NOT WANT MY MW2 ACCOUNT HACKED AN BOOSTED. There's a reason I gave that game up after lvl 70 thanks.

I could go on, and science knows I want to, but I'll leave it at this. Battlefield plays differently than Modern Warfare, sure they are both FPS', but sometimes Battlefield games require the use of your brain. You can destroy environments, and you can take down trees as well. There is a reason you get classes, and not a handful of weapons with which to make a build. You should try and treat your squad like your best friends, sometimes they are damned good at their job, so why shouldn't you be?  

That said, kudos to the tank team who brought an entire building down around me as I picked off troops who passed by their tank. You guys, are fucking cool.  (/endrant)

"So, Who Actually Liked Stalker: Call Of Pripyat?","I thought it was just horrible. 

This is my experience with the game:

&lt;rant&gt;
So, you start after being dropped out of the sky into the field with a useless pistol, useless assault rifle, and the best weapon in the game: the knife. There's no introduction or tutorial, so you have to go and see the button configs yourself. The game directs you to a helicopter crash site, which you run to at superhuman speed, but it's up a small hill, so you can't get to it. So you go see a NPC who asks you to come help him kill some monsters. He teleports you... somewhere. You don't have to kill any monsters, you just jump off a cliff, and then teleport again. That brings you to the top of the small hill where the helicopter is. After checking the crash site, you run to the local safe settlement, which is filled with talking statues. They speak frat boy. You talk to one of the statues and grab a side quest. Mine was to find a container in a car, in a cave. So I go to the cave, get the container, then kill a bunch of hilarious looking, horribly animated, ""snooks""?. You kill them with the knife, because it's the only weapon that does the job. Then you walk outside, run back to the settlement, then split up the loot. You ask for another side quest, which is to clear out a ""bloodsucker"" nest. You run there at 100 mph, killing a couple of pigoons on the way with your knife. You get there, and the worst actor ever is there to greet you. He says the blood suckers are inside a small building, so you go inside, and kill them all with your knife by running after them at 100 mph or sitting in a corner and killing them one by one. During the side quest, you collect a bunch of dropped weapons. Making your way back to the settlement, you think: Nice! I can sell these for some $$$! But when you get back, you need to find someone to repair them for you. That takes forever, because he's a loner who sits in the back of one of the dorm rooms and demands booze. Anyway, you make no money on the guns because it cost so much to repair them. Then you get another side quest, which is to try to get into an abandoned ship covered in flying unkillable invisible magnifying glasses which kill you. 

This all takes place in a brown, and (unless there's a lightning storm) boring swamp. The game engine will also stutter every couple of minutes. Animations are totally unnatural. The characters are uninteresting. The story is a joke. The enemies are either too easy or way too hard. Gameplay is both uninteresting and confusing.

Going to extreme lengths to play one game,"I'm a big Star Wars fan, and have been dying to play KOTOR 2. Unfortunately, unlike the first one, it is officially unavailable for Mac OS X. There is a Cider port available (cider ports are ports of games from Windows to Mac that make them able to run natively, without any emulation on your part), but I had sound issues with that, being that there was none. Up with this, I would not put. I decided that it was between running Windows 7 on my Mac (I already have it installed in Boot Camp) or setting up a dusty-ass old PC for the sole purpose of KOTOR 2. I went with the latter, because I hate not being able to use Mac OS X. So, it's taken me all day, but I have officially gone from an empty hard-drive in a computer with shitty hardware to a computer running Windows XP, and being fully capable to run KOTOR 2. And now it's installed. Unfortunately, it's too late for me to want to play, so that will wait until tomorrow.
Have any of you ever jumped through such hoops to play a single game?

TL;DR - KOTOR 2 wouldn't work with Mac. Set up a really old PC for the sole purpose of running it. You done this?",gaming

Hey r/gaming. I've got an interesting idea that may be feasible but would possibly require the utmost trust... How would you feel about a reddit game-exchange? More of my brainchild inside.,"* First off, forgive my formatting... I'm not a programmer.
* Secondly, I thought the idea of trading games with another person would be a viable thing to do on here. I would say that there could be no exchange of currency... just trading a game you dont play for one that you would (Of equal value, monetarily/necessity.)
* I've been mulling over this idea for quite some time, now. I think there needs to be some ground rules... I would say maybe 1yr+ is considered pretty trustworthy--provided they have the level of karma that would be acceptable for a year vet.
* I mean, look, i have about a dozen games that i cannot hock on cragslist (EVEN ME2) and would rather just try to ""stick it to the man""(Gamestop) by just trading with eachother. Jesus, it would only cost us less than a dollar to send a game through USmail... and to trade a game you dont play... its probably considered a profit on both ends!
* Is anyone interested? If you are, what would your ideas be as far as execution? A subreddit? Or perhaps a different site/forum to use as a base of operations? Have sub-categories like Xbox, PS3, PC and more? You tell me! Eager to hear from you! Ill try to stay on top of this as much as possible. PS: If youre a web dev, maybe this is right up your alley...

I need help identifying a game.,"Hey Reddit, I come to you with a grand question about a game I used to play on the pc, about 9, maybe 10 years ago. 

- It was a ship/naval simulation. had beautiful 2D graphics 
- Timed in, I guess 1700, or sometime near that age. (no steam powered engines)
- You could chose to start either in England or in Spain
- You started with a small ship (4-8 cannons i guess) and after completing missions you could advance to get a Manowar. 
- After a few missions you could chose to become pirate and hunt whales in the northern sea 
- You had the whole globe available to sail (north&amp;south America. even Australia). no fast sailing. 
- You could chose the way you fired your cannons: all at once, alternating, in succession. You could also chose what kind of canon ball s to use: grape shot, something to destroy the sails, etc
- You had to buy rations for your crew. rations that ranged from dry biscuits to meat and/or fruit. 
- I remember playing the game under Windows 98
- I think it came on two cds, but my memory might be fuzzy.

That's about all i can remember about it now. 
So, anyone know the name of that game? It's been a loong time and I'd really want to replay it.

Why can't anyone seem to stop PC gaming hacks?,"I'm simply amazed that with the plague that has been cheating at PC games, nobody has been capable of finding a solution to it that is even 85% effective.

"I started Oblivion, got frustrated and went back to Wow - let me know something...","I'm not much of a gamer when it comes to FPS games. I own BioShock, Gears of War, L4D/L4D-2, COD4 and a few others. The only three games I have ever finished are COD4, Portal and Fable II. 

I have decided I'm not so much a fan of your typical FPS but I do get very into RPGs.

I loved Fable II and was absolutely addicted to it till I had nothing else to do but some minor achievements. I then, instead of starting over, decided to try Oblivion. 

I gave up a few times starting out because of the combat - I sucked balls but eventually got a little better. I started to really get the hang of it and then I got pulled into WoW (my wife and a couple of my friends all play with me so it's much more social). 

I feel guilty for ditching Oblivion but, and here's the key, I was playing it on the 360. I have absolutely decided that I am NOT a fan of console gaming. Having a keyboard and mouse is just so much better - I know WoW would suck (and be almost impossible) on a console. 

I'm going to assume that Oblivion would be better on a PC, as would Fallout 3 (which I also have on the 360).

Theory : DRM would get better if it was in demos,"* Point the First : Demos of games come out either a scant amount of time before the actual game, or after the actual game.

Part of the justification (for some) of pirating a game is to see if they like it before buying it. But of course why would anyone then buy it when they already have it. (unless it's MP) Releasing a well polished demo well in advance of the actual game serves to increase interest and give people a taste of what the game is like.

* Point the Second : Demos never have DRM.

""Why put DRM on a Demo? They're free already!"" you ask?  Because if everyone got a good preview of some of the draconian DRM methods that are being used, *before* having to fork over $60, sales might actually be affected.
*****
Face it, the feedback loop in gaming is somewhat incomplete.  When you go buy a game, you pay your money up front. If that game is crap, or uses DRM you don't like, then what?  Sell it to a GameStop for half price? Heck, you already spent $60, might as well play it. Even if it sucks, and you tell your friends not to buy it, they may have either already bought it, or are unconvinced by your recommendation because of the huge hype surrounding it. (\*cough\* MW2)

There's currently no way to tell the publisher their game sucked so bad that you want a refund. Asking a publisher for a refund is laughable. But that kind of feedback is a key component in almost any other service or goods based business.  This was the best alternative I could come up with.",gaming

"No matter how much you all bitch about Ubisoft's DRM, you'll eventually fall in line and start calling it a helpful end-user product like you did with Steam.","I'm not saying Steam is all that bad - in fact, a lot of the problems that were there initially are gone. However, it's still adware that screws with a lot of people's abilities to enjoy products they've paid for by virtue of its 'piracy prevention features' but people have adapted and grown used to it.

You know, like how you get used to hearing about people dying in the Middle East, or how you get used to erectile dysfunction as time passes. It's just something you learn to accept... In time, with a few tacked-on end-user features, you'll 'be happy' for Ubisoft to ravage your computer.

"AskGamingReddit: My boss has offered the office for a LAN party for one night, what games can we play?","There will be 7 players, using the office PCs which have on-board graphics meaning the games need to be either old or casual.

There is a projector with a VGA connector, so splitscreen or all on one screen games are a possibility.

Also, 2 of the players are my bosses, both of whom have very little gaming experience under their belt, whilst the other 5 are all hardened gamers (FPS/RTS/RPG). As a result, we need games that can level the playing field a bit.

So far the list is:

Mashed (Racing, 4 player on one screen, much like micromachines)

Quake3/Live (While some of us will surely dominate, as far as an FPS goes, it is basically as barebones as you can get as far as learning controls/gameplay).

We are thinking of steering away from RPGs too, basically as we are looking for the least grind-y games, as well as not having to teach the novices the fundamentals of RPGing. Playing an RPG with a n00b usually means everyone is either waiting around while the new player reads everything, or everybody splits up through impatience. I was thinking league of legends, however despite it's freeness and n00bness, it's still pretty advanced for a person that's never touched an RPG before.

The possibility of emulation has come up too, especially with the projector being VGA only, bringing in consoles isn't really an option.

The games also have to be compatible with pizza.

A specific request: Help find me a game I can snoop around in and make use of random items!,"Here's the deal /r/gaming, I'm a nosy person and I love getting into other people's stuff. You could say I have a sort of fetish for trespassing and scavenging. Thievery works pretty well here. Exploration fits nicely, as does an ability to do something with almost anything you can find. I therefor find scavenging *really* fun.

Oblivion (with mods) is a great example, it's open-ended, stealing benefits you in various ways, and the sneaking system isn't *terrible*. There is this certain thrill I get about deciding which items to take, hiding from anyone that is around, and searching for hidden goodies. I've tried Thief, but I just couldn't get into it. GTA doesn't fit this for me, obviously.

So, how about some recommendations that might match?",gaming

"/r/gaming, I've been searching fruitlessly for a vertical-scrolling shooter game for the PC from 7-8ish years ago. Can you help me out?","**FOUND:** Thanks to Zrephel for finding the game *Raptor: Call of the Shadows* in less than **half an hour**. I love reddit.


I have a story to go along with this. So I played this game a lot at my local YMCA. I absolutely loved it, and I was the nerdiest kid probably who played it every day. Anyway, some day in the last week of camp was my birthday. I got a package from my uncle in the mail. Inside was a bunch of things, but one of them was a set of shooters and, sure enough, Raptor was one of them. Looking back, the funniest part was randomly getting a game that was 8 years old at the same time I played a game that was 8 years old at the YMCA.


It's probably classified as shoot-'em-up, actually

Here's what I do remember:

* It probably came out 7-8 years ago
* It wasn't a space shooter, but it did have ships
* It scrolled vertically
* You could press some combination of buttons like cheats to make things appear in the level, like one combination made snakes or salamanders
* You bought upgrades from a shop
* It had a weapon that was a laser which completely destroyed bosses, like in 3 seconds
* It may seem obvious, but it's 2-D
* It also has an overhead view
* I think you fly over a destroyed city

When you play the game, it's usual; each stage has a bunch of little enemies leading up to a big boss at the end.

I'll add more as I remember. Thanks in advance if you help me figure this out!",gaming

"Dear GameReddit, I made a mistake. Aliens vs Predator (PC) is a bloody mess. Here's my apology.","Back story: Over the last few weeks I've been defending Aliens vs Predator, saying that it had tonnes of atmosphere and that the retail title would be more refined than the demo, which I've enjoyed. 

I was wrong. 

While I love the atmosphere, the graphics, the gameplay. The game is an alpha at best. 

My system had no problems running the demo and no problems running other games either. When it comes to AvP though - I get constant stuttering, the intro movies sound was horribly corrupted (thank god for subtitles) and it has gotten to the stage - 2 days after purchasing - that I give up and await a patch. The game is unplayable. 

Reading the SEGA forum for the game tells a similar tale - for every post commending the game there are 3 more complaining that it won't run properly. 

So here's my rant and apology to you folks, I was sure the game would be well constructed and a joy to play. I was wrong. To any PC owners, I'd consider this a warning to hold off until a patch is released. Don't take the smooth running of the demo as a sign that the full release will run the same.",gaming

Does anyone else think Goldeneye 007 is tremendously overrated?,"I understand that nostalgia clouds thinking (I'm nostalgic for my childhood gaming too, but my childhood was NES/SNES days, not N64).  However, every time I read a post about console shooters, or even something recent like the Perfect Dark remake, the automatic comparison is to bring up Goldeneye 007.

Look, folks, Goldeneye wasn't really that great a game.  Load it up in an emulator today.

* The animation and framerate sucked.  Characters looked like they were gliding sometimes and having seizures others.
* The single player was helped immensely by the Bond story.  If you took out the Bond backdrop the ""missions"" were incredibly lame and the character development non-existant.
* The only saving grace for multiplayer was split screen, and a lot of other console games did it better.

And that's just comparing it to its console brethren.  By the time Goldeneye came out, both Quake 1 and 2 were out, Unreal was out and Half-Life/UT were just around the corner.  I know rose-colored glasses can make anything look good, but are people really going to compare Goldeneye 007 to Half-Life?  Seriously?

In short, I end my nerd tirade with the following: Goldeneye 007 was ok.  Perfect Dark was pretty good.  Neither was anything to write home about.

It seems once I get to level 15-20 depending on the game, I lose interest. I think my problem is that if I don't feel like I am making significant progress at a good rate, I don't enjoy it as much.

I've been ganked and looted bare 3 times since beginning 3 hours ago.,"I'm playing Darkfall. And I still haven't logged back in since the last time my corpse was picked of all my wares by a duo of the opposing faction. I'll be frank: as i'm writing this i'm unsure if i'll bother to continue for a second month, but that is no less than 28 days away.

I left the one of the starting ork towns with minimal direction in my quest to harvest mandrakes. and unfortunately these harvesting nodes aren't in a well protected garden, enclosed by trenches and protected by guard towers. they are outside of any figurative comfort zone, in an unpredictable, virtual wilderness. 

while harvesting, i was attacked and killed by a goblin scout who was apparently attacking me far longer than i thought. i died, leaving my corpse and all of my belongings at the place of death. i'm summoned to my bindstone and immediately start to sprint to my corpse, but i saw another ork running down the hill i was just on. i approach my gravestone and see that i was picked clean. i ran back to the starter town with an empty inventory, save my starter weapon, completely naked. 

i find the suspected ork nearby harvesting some ore, and begin to plan an ambush to rightfully claim back what is mine. i approach a rock where i draw out my bow. carefully aiming for the ork's head, i release. ...unfortunately i was nearby a guard tower and consequently destroyed. i was looted completely bare once more. 

my brother, who started before me, came to the town where i started and graciously handed me another batch of armor he crafted, many starter weapons to use and to bank, gold and even a mount. 

freshly equipped, i head off to the ork capital of metal heart and decide to fish nearby a stream exiting into the ocean. as i'm fishing i hear a bow string being pulled- a most distinct sound as the bow arches back. before i'm able to fully realize what is going on, i see a human in armor i don't recognize charging to my pole wielding ork, while a dwarf is on the other end of the stream sending volleys of arrows. i provide futile resistance and once again die, this time from an opposing faction. i return to my corpse after a hellish corpse run to find everything my brother just gave, mount included was thieved.",gaming

Should I upgrade my graphics card or buy a console?,"Hello all.  I'm at a bit of a crossroads.  2 days ago I submitted a question asking for help to replace my computers mid range graphics card.  This submission is here



Now, I'm about ready to buy a new power supply and a pretty good graphics card, and I realize, I could buy a new Xbox 360 or PS3 for around the same price.  Now, I've returned fairly recently to the world of gaming.  The last console I owned was a PS2, and I had to part ways with it in 2003, long before the PS2 had run out of life.

Anyhow, I know I'll get a wide range of answers, but I'd just like to hear the ideals and opinions of some other intelligent people before I make a choice.  Seeing as how I trust the opinions of Redditors more than I do any other group on the internet, this seemed like a good place to ask.

Finished Dragon Age: Origins today. Was I doing it wrong?,"I finished Dragon Age: Origins on hard today. I used a Mage, Morrigan, Alistair, and Sten for the whole thing.

It sort of felt like the game compelled me to cheese out many victories. Did anyone have a different experience? Here's what I mean:

1. For most of the tougher fights I would set up an ambush, and have Alistair edge forward until he ""woke up"" as few enemies as possible, and then lured them back to my ambush. Often it seemed like I would have been crushed by thirty monsters at once if I didn't do this. This also made all the traps in the game fairly pointless, because by the time I got to them, I could just wait a little bit after I triggered them, and I was up to full health again. Taking this to its extreme, I'd often only use ranged weapons just to avoid moving forward enough to wake up the next monsters.

2. It seems like there were very few spells that were reliably useful (especially toward the end): cone of cold and stone of rain worked on almost everything, but it seemed like the yellow-name creatures pretty much ignored everything else except direct damage. Fireball and mindblast worked sometimes.... Did I miss something?

Here's what I would like to see in Civilization V regarding nukes...,"Nukes in Civ IV weren't as fun as they ought to be. Ok, ok, I know a single ICBM wouldn't realistically kill everything in a city, but it would sure as hell shut down that city's economy as if it had been totally destroyed. If nukes weren't coded in such a tricky manner, I'd mod Civ IV to act like this, and I can only hope they're something like this (or easily moddable to act like this) in Civ V:

1. A nuke destroys a city. When a nuke hits, the city is destroyed, unless it has shelters or other bombproof buildings to preserve population. In the best case scenario, the city shuts down for a turn while people are getting their shit together.

2. If the city IS totally destroyed, it spawns a settler or a specialized refugee unit or something. The fallout zone around the city is unsettlable, but the refugee can either start a new tiny city or join another one like you could do with settlers in older Civ's.

3. When you launch a nuke, it doesn't hit until your next turn. If the person being nuked has patrolling aircraft/radar/some detection system, then they are alerted to the imminent nuke on their next turn after you launch it. This is when they would launch a counterstrike, resulting in MAD. If a nuke fails to launch (spy ability: freeze a nuke in a city for one turn?) and is still in a city when it is struck by an enemy nuke, it's destroyed.

4. If a nuke destroys a capital city (i.e., no bomb shelters to save enough of the population), that civilization ""breaks"". I think there's a mod already which does a similar thing; if a country is shit enough, its cities split up into two or more new civs based on culture, similar to how cities on another continent can be freed to create a new civ in BTS.

5. If enough of an enemy civ is destroyed via nukes, they lose technologies. Why shouldn't your game be allowed to continue after MAD? You've just been blasted back into the iron age or something, but you're still around, at least. Perhaps you retain control of a single city and all your other cities go barbarian and you have to recapture them or something.",gaming

I'm working on a research project at a university. We're using people playing video games as our research subjects (taking physiological measures as people play video games). We need to use a free, interesting game that meets a few requirements, which I'll list in order of importance. 

1)  The game needs to be continuous. That is, a player may die but no game over type screens necessitating a restart in game playing.

2) Dynamic difficulty adjustment. Ideally the game will get easier if the player is bad and more difficult if the player is skilled.

3) Can be played with one hand so that the player's other hand can be used in the physiological measures. This isn't as important as the above.

Any help would be greatly appreciated and might cause me to love you forever. Thanks!",gaming

Gaming Reddit: I Want to Write Reviews...,"Hey Reddit.  I really want to get into writing gaming reviews.  I started writing a review blog, ages ago - it's more than a year since I posted a review - but I really want to do it.

Here are my reasons:
I really love gaming. I've got a PS3, hooked up to a HDTV, and I love it. I play racing games, sport games, adventure games, flying games, shooting games, etc.

I want to get free stuff!  I'd love to get my dirty paws on games before they get released, and write reviews about them.  I'm not scared to call a game pants if it is.

I feel like I have the gift to write.  I've published a few books, so writing is not something I take lightly.

So Reddit, how can I really get into this?  How can I turn this from a hobby/blog to something more?  In other words, how can I go from a bloke writing reviews after playing a game in his spare time to getting paid to play games then write reviews on them?

Thanks in advance!",gaming

Looking to start playing a new MMO - I need Reddit's help!,"It's been a while since I've gotten a new MMO and I've been craving one, but I'm not sure what to get. When MMOs first started coming out I used to try pretty much all of them, but that's kind of impossible now, so your advice would be greatly appreciated.

Some that I've played and liked before:

Ultima Online

Asheron's Call 1 and 2 (I've played 1 a lot and loved it)

Star Wars Galaxies - I liked this one a lot before all of the changes

Everquest 1 and 2 - I really liked the crafting system in 2 but didn't play either one all that much

Dungeon and Dragons Online

I'm not a power gamer by any stretch of the imagination. I don't think I've ever hit them max level of any game.

Would anyone on reddit like to start a game company with me?,"This is a sounding to determine interest. I won't go into much detail. 

I'm a game designer of the old-school variety: cards, boards, pens and paper. My job involves creating educational games but my passion is more complex scifi fantasy fare. 

What I bring to the table are games with a focus on strategy, original game play, and immersive stories. I have need of people with business acumen, artistic ability, web or print skills/know-how, and legal expertise. 

An ideal start for me is an online, card-based game with players derived mainly from the reddit community. A flat, one-time fee gives users access to all the game's features, including unlimited copies of all cards for deck design. 

We can charge users a nominal fee for alternate card artwork and backgrounds, splitting revenue with artists from the community--community being the key. Our company will be attuned to the needs of its users, incorporating them as much as possible in the development and improvement process.

It is an ambitious goal. I can settle for different or less. What I need now is to see who is interested in making it happen. If interest is high we will move to the next step of planning and organization.

Things we will need to decide are: Will we have customers? How will we make a profit? Can we make a profit? How do we obtain funding? Do we need it? What is our time line?  Who is involved and in what capacity? How do we make decisions? etc

This post will help me decide if the project is feasible. Please be frank and realistic. 

I will check back regularly to answer any questions. 

Edit: Programmers are also wanted. I'm sorry, my print background and general ignorance of your field caused me to omit you. 

Edit 2: From what I've seen so far, it may be best to divide ownership of the company among the main contributing members: the designer (me), the programmer(s), and I would like a president in charge of business and marketing. We can bring people on if needed, keeping it small as possible. We would split profit evenly. The downside is we would have no one controlling party, muddying the decision making process. I have a meeting with my adviser soon, I will ask him his opinion.

How to translate game ratings into something useful,"As we all know game ratings tend to be off, if a game gets a rating below 70% you know it is going to stink, but if it stinks why is it being given a score that says it is above average?

Anyway. I went over to Metacritic and pulled all the scores for the PS3, PS2, PS1, Xbox 360, Xbox, Wii, Game Cube, N64 and PC. I then looked at the scores for the lowest ranked 5% of the games (7,791 games total if your wondering) and assigned that range a real value of 5% and continued in that fashion up the tree.

This is what I found.

* A score of 1%-43% = Lowest 5% of all scores
* 44%-50% = 10%
* 51%-54% = 15%
* 55%-57% = 20%
* 58%-60% = 25%
* 61%-63% = 30%
* 64%-65% = 35%
* 66%-67% = 40%
* 68%-69% = 45%
* 70%-71% = 50%
* 72%        = 55%
* 73%-74% = 60%
* 75%-76% = 65%
* 77%-78% = 70%
* 79%-80% = 75%
* 81%        = 80%
* 82%-83% = 85%
* 84%-86% = 90%
* 87%-89% = 95%
* 90%        = 96%
* 91%        = 97%
* 92%        = 98%
* 93%-94% = 99%
* 95%-100% = 100%

I.E. If Metacritic lists a games average score as 60% then it has a score that is lower then 75% of all the games ever ranked (Thus my ranking of 25%).",gaming

"Fellow Reddit gamers, help me pick a game (FPS for PC)","So, I'm thinking about getting a multiplayer shoot'em up. I haven't played multiplayer PC FPS games since the days of Doom 2 and Duke Nukem 3d. So far, I got my eyes on Left 4 Dead 2, Team Fortress 2 and Battlefield: Bad company. My computer isn't very powerful, but I intend to upgrade it soon. 

So, which game do you guys recommend?  Which game has the most content and diversity so I'll enjoy it for a lot of time before i get bored?

Thanks in advance.

EDIT: Thanks guys, I'll check out Quake live later. So far, i think i'll go with Team Fortress 2. Looks like the most fun of the bunch.",gaming

Do any other Redditors play Blood Bowl on the PC?,"So yeah.. I used to love the board game, but havent played in a long time. Then I overheard some friends talking about a computer version, so I went looking around and found a PC copy. 

I was all excited to rebuild my classic Dwarf team and said ""Hay guys! I got that game too!"" and of course, they all have the 360 version. (facepalm).

I have to get all of this off my chest... (MW2),"I love paying Call of Duty Modern Warfare. I really do. Some of you elitist gamers may hate me for saying that, but it's the truth. However, there are a few things that have been making my blood boil.

Firstly, in Free For All, the respawning is terrible. Before, you'd have the odd unlucky time where you respawned right in front of somebody and they pumped some lead into your back. Now, being shot in the back because of a crappy respawn is something that I've had to endure in nearly every single game that I've played - multiple times throughout. The respawning is so bad that I've been able to see how the person who shot me was killed. i.e. I can see THEIR killcam where they got killed, right before they came to life again behind me. It's ridiculous.

I'm a fan of using claymores. I get it that those with the Scrambler perk have the ability to extend the timeframe between a claymore being set off and it actually exploding. That's not an issue. My problem is that you can a) jump and miraculously survive a claymore explosion and b) people can just run past them and escape the blast. What is the point in having claymores if users have to stop dead in their tracks for them to be effective? I can kill somebody by knifing them in the leg, yet I can waltz past a claymore explosion as if nothing ever happened?

Latency annoys the living hell out of me. The amount of times I've been shot by bullets that seem as if they can bend around corners is amazing. Another example - I was just about to get a killstreak the other day when I came up against a guy one-on-one. I was quick to draw, firing bullets at him with conviction... I was 100% sure that I had hit him and that I had fired first. But no. I was the one who ended up dying. I then checked the connection bars and sure enough he was a bar higher than me.

I play in a map that I hate because I think ""hey, maybe after this, we'll get a map that I like."" The next game comes and JUST before the match is about to start, the host ends the game. What annoys me even more is that I know somebody in my party has the ability to be the host.

I'm running around in Free For All and somebody brings out a Harrier. I go to shoot down the Harrier, thinking that I'm doing everyone a favour and somebody shoots me in the back. You'd think that they'd wait until I've fired the rocket before they blasted me in the back!

EDIT: Dying because I got hit with a flash grenade is also pretty rage-inducing.",gaming

Gaming reddit: What do you look for in an RPG?,"Now, I'm just curious because I've been talking to people and they all have different likes and dislikes.

Personally? I like story and emotion in my RPGs, good ambiance and engaging characters that make you feel for them. Not the unstoppable godkids of Disgaea but flawed and feeling characters, like Lucas from Mother3 or Locke from FF6. Or the Cecil/Kain dynamic in FF4.

Some people I know just like the scenery. They like seeing the maps and various landscapes. 

Some people like the idea of a very linear RPG that they can play, then play again and try to get a better time in. Some people are completionists, some are minimalists, some like to understand and therefore exploit the battle systems. What do YOU like?",gaming

"Dear /r/gaming: Help me identify an old game. Help me get laid. Help me, /r/gaming... you're my only hope!","So my girlfriend and I have been seeing each other for a couple months now and things have been going great, except for one problem... I haven't been invited to bed yet. I brought this up the other day. To my surprise, she agreed to sleep with me but with one condition: identify a game she used to play but can't remember the name of and she will let me ravish her.

All I know is that this game...

- came out for PC (Windows, not DOS) in the '90s, possibly around 1997

- takes place mostly or completely in a castle of some kind

- is a sidescrolling platformer (""you can go side to side or up and down and you're looking at your character from the side"")

- involves collecting ""pretty jewels"" of various colors; it ends up being more of a puzzle game as she doesn't remember having to kill any enemies/having weapons

- it ""had really good graphics for its time"" and ""really good music""

Sorry there's not more to go on, but that is why I have been forced to seek your generous and benevolent aid, reddit.

Now, we all know that kindness is its own reward, but as a bonus reward to you, dear redditors, the first time I bed her, I will scream out the username of anyone who solves the mystery for me. We will also name our firstborn after your sock puppet novelty account.

"""I hate that sense of entitlement among gamers these days...""","EDIT: I just deleted a gazillion paragraphs of text to shorten this to my actual point:

I think whining about whining is pointless. There is no point in criticizing fanboys for having a sense of entitlement. I know that way I'm whining about whining about whining... But I suggest breaking the cycle and settling on the two things that matter: Either you love something or you hate it. But don't criticize the others for being passionate about it. Just have *your* argument for *your* point of view instead of spending so much time ridiculing the other.

But yea, please support people trying to protect genres and styles that are getting eliminated in sake of trying to create something closer to the current mainstream. Why not just make a new game? Why drag a popular name of a much-beloved classic into an new game when the original fans aren't even considered a target group? The best reason for franchises to exist is to keep a certain style alive. And someone has to lean against the 100-million dollar marketing machinery that has zero interest in depth and complexity in gameplay. I'm sure that many gamers, nowadays, do not even realize that with games getting dumbed down, they miss out on something they would really, really like. And publishers miss the fact that they have to keep *some* niches open for when the mainstream realizes that all games are getting the same.

"I can't find advice on Steam, maybe reddit can help me...","I'm looking for any help you tech savvy redditors can offer on a problem I am having. I downloaded the lucasarts adventure pack last weekend from Steam to play, and installed from it Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. It load fine, but after playing anywhere from 5-10 minutes, the screen goes wonky. vertical lines run up and down in the game windows (and only in the game windows) distorting the picture, and a smaller 'square' of verticle lines also follow the mouse around. The game runs fine, its just impossible to see whats going on. When I quit the game, though, my screen goes black, and will not turn back on. I have to turn on the PC using the power button.

I am using an nVidia GTX8800 video card through an apple cinema display monitor.

I have two monitors attached to this computer, the second being an older 15"" LCD that only runs at 1024. I tried playing the game on that screen, and had the same problem.

I tried turning down the resolution on my main monitor to 1024. The problem got worse (instead of just vertical lines, the whole screen went crazy.)

Question on Windows 7 64-bit and gaming,"So I'm looking to upgrade my computer from a dual boot XP Pro 32/ Vista Ultimate x64 to solely Windows 7. I've heard the win 7 64 support is alot better than Vista but I wanted r/gaming's opinion.

My biggest concern with the upgrade is the impact on my games. I've been on 32bit systems for a long time. I tried out the Vista 64 system but  was having  a lot of trouble with my games, especially  steam. I just could never get it to work. Generally my computer is used for surfing the web or playing games and because of my heavy game use and inability to get Steam working on Vista I rarely used the system.

I'm looking into the Win7 x64 but I'm a little nervous that I'll lose alot of my games with the transition. What should I keep in mind during the transition?

What is the most tacked sequal or game you have encountered ?,"Ever have a game or series you loved?

Get excited and joyous when a sequal or prequal is annocend?

Then when you by it, have your hopes crushed by worthless piece of tacked on crap which nearly ruins the the previous game or series?

There are many offenders in this catagory but have any of you experienced it? 

For a good example of what i mean, lets use the malformed incestous lump of half aborted smegma which is Final Fantasy X-2.

I had been playing the Final Fantasy series from IV to X and loved every moment of it until this loathsome lump of quief appeared. 

This game put me off the series and I have not bought nor do not plan to buy another Final fantasy title since.

My thinking was, if this was the crap Square-enix thought they could produce off of the back of a successful game ,then its better to cut ties than to see the games I liked, whored out like a 40yr old Thai hookers.

It always suprises me, the lack of Nerd rage over the title, hell it was the first Final fantasy sequal for christ sakes! 

They had a good potential story to move on from, hell even a underdeveloped antagonist from the previous game (even if it would of broke the plot, it would of made more bloody sense than the actual story they used!). It could of been great!

But instead, every way they could of messed up they did (and sorry folks, the battle system cannot redeem it no matter how much you like watching girls dressing up)

Instead of an actual sequal, what we got was 3 girls prancing about looking for clothes while playing endless mini games, and a plot which was obviously tacked on just to give another reason for said Girls to finding dresses and play more mini games.

This game is a perfect example of how a Developer messed up on what could of been a excellent chance to make a decent follow on gameand totally missed the mark.

The Gaming Industry Needs To Change - They Are Walking All Over Us.,"This list would get very long, very fast if I listed every offending game.

A sampling of the things game companies are trying to pull -

No dedicated server or LAN Support in the following games:

* Call of Duty : Modern Warfare 2
* Bioshock 2

Starcraft 2 and Command and Conquer 4 have no LAN support.

One Time Activation Codes in New Copies of Games to Unlock:

* Multiplayer ($20) - SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs Fireteam Bravo 3
* Cerberus Network ($15) - Mass Effect 2
* DLC ($20) - Halo Wars (Platinum Hits)
* Map Pack ($10) - Call of Duty 4: GOTY Edition (First printing)

Bad DRM:

* Constant Internet connection - Assasin's Creed 2
* Re-authentication every 10 days - Spore

Games that do things right - All add-ons on seperate, reusable disc: (Price of DLC - Game name)

* $50 - Fallout 3: GOTY
* $30 - Halo 3: ODST

Game companies are trying to see what they can pull off. Can you imagine the outrage there would be if you had to activate commentary on a DVD, or pay $5 for it if you got the DVD used? Think about how different your life would be if Starcraft did not have LAN support. Would it be fair to require activation to play the last 5 tracks of a CD?

These companies are taking first sale doctrine and running all over it. Though legal, these things shouldn't happen.

Played MW2 last night due to the BC2 demo closing. It took a whopping 5 mins....,"for me to remember why I'd shelved MW2. The first game I'm in is Domination in the GW playlist on Wasteland. Heading in I kind of decided that I was going to attempt to play tactical, help my team &amp; avoid being cheap. 

That didn't last long. 

I join mid game and popping baddies with my intervention. After a few kills in a fucking ninja sprints at me from nowhere. I switch to my TMP and unload on him. I'm quite sure I hit him. I'm quite sure that there is not a being on this planet that minus the presence of PCP could have remained standing. However, I'm dealing with a true ninja here. A second later he whips out a handy tac knife and I'm done for. 

Next I spawn with a teammate who is being shot. I'm not fucking kidding. He is being shot to shit and for some reason the spawn system puts me there. Neat. Dead again. 

The gheyness couldn't possibly continue for much longer, right? 

Next spawn, opposite side of the map. I'm alive for half a second when my ninja buddy (who I guess was calling in air support) stands up and slits my throat again. 

Sigh. At this point I was getting frustrated. A quick class swap to OMA + Tubes and a few minutes later I have chopper gunner out. 

I remember thinking when I began playing mw2 that IW had made every effort to ensure that things were balanced. I remember feeling like for every new weapon / attachment / perk I tried I was giving something up. This is not the case. I just didn't have the recipe to the secret sauce yet. 

Over the next couple of rounds (I only played 3 or 4. It was about all I could stand) I noticed that regardless of if it's an objective type or straight up TDM things can usually be decided by 1 player. He may not win every game in objective but at the end of the day he doesn't care. You get about same points and better stats from running a muck.  (and yeah, I've seen this before last night - it just seemed a bit more apparent as I haven't been playing mw2 as of late)

Is Wii worth it alone for the Virtual Console?,"It seems like people like to hate on Wii for being made for the casual gamer.  I prefer PC over console for my main gaming but is the Wii worth it for the VC?

What do you guys think?

EDIT:  Thanks for the responses and suggestions on alternatives.  My other and biggest plus is missing out on many GC games, this would give me a chance to try them, not to mention new Zelda/Mario games.  Also girls are much more likely to sit and play Wii than they are to sit at my computer.

So just beat Heavy Rain and...,"I was surprised at how much *fun* I had. The story was an amazing ride, the twists and turns that it takes you on and the ability to change every detail of it makes the experience enthralling to say the least. The character development was also really well done, I started to genuinely care about what was going to happen to them, and thus the way I played through the game changed dramatically. The graphics weren't perfect but they were pretty close. The facial features of each of the characters, their clothing, the environments were fantastic (hell even the sex scene was very tastefully done). And the soundtrack has got to be one of my favorite parts of the game, the score is hauntingly beautiful. It beautifully conveys the fear, depression, and hopelessness that all the characters are feeling.

Anyways, Heavy Rain is an amazing and innovative experience that all should at least try. It rivals a great movie or novel in the realm of story telling, and the constant quick time events that the entire game is made of actually begin to be fun and challenging.",gaming
Is Mass Effect 2 too easy on the PC?,"Is it because the mouse keyboard control?  Any Xbox or PS3 people notice this?

You have to log in at least three times to accomplish any simple task, sometimes with ""e-mail address"" and sometimes with ""screen name"". Some of the BF games had a completely separate ""login system"" which confused things double.

That being said, they had a link that said ""How's our site? Take our survey!"" .. I clicked on it and it took me to a survey that gave me some non-applicable multiple-choice options about their site and an ""other"" comment box that was long enough for about 12 characters (not even as long as the otheroptions).

Hey Reddit help me please find an RTS,"What i remember about it:

- Its from 1996-2000

- Has isometric graphics (like Red Alert, starcraft, warcraft 2,...), not real 3D

- Is set in the near future, you build mostly tanks.

- The unique aspect was that every unit consists of 2-3 parts, and you need to assemble it.(like in CIV: Alpha centaury or Earth 2150) For example it has tracked movement and a Machinegun as cannon. I remember that one of the best mobility option was that it had 9 spheres as wheels.

- you could build infantry too, but they were totally useless.

- I think (but im not sure) that most of the units had ammo which needed to be resupplied by helicopters.

Does anyone else find Mad Moxxi from Borderlands hot?,"I’ve been playing this game called Borderlands recently, and there is an area called the Underdome, which is basically a gladiator style arena.

She has a bit of a Harley Quinn vibe… and is starting to overtake Princess Peach. Intead of having a girl dress up as Peach and having someone else dress up as Donkey Kong and throw barrels at me, i’m thinking that maybe i would like her to dress up as Mad Moxxi instead, and give a disinterested and demeaning play by play, preferably with a megaphone, while i’m rocking her world.

Anyone else think that PS2 &gt; Current PC/Consoles?,"I used to own a 360, and I currently have a gaming PC that I built, but I find my old PS2 that I bought in 2006 to be way more fun and enjoyable than the 360 ever was and the game I have on PC. I play a large range of games of many genres, which the PS2 have a great choice of. 

I know the graphics aren't that great, and a mouse/kb is more accurate for shooters, but I think that the PS2 makes up for it. One of my big arguments is that there are many great quality games out there. It seems to me that developers are spending more time on multilayer than making a solid and enjoyable single player. With PS2, the online play wasn't really the spotlight of the console (since you'd have to by an adapter for the fatty). 

Another great thing about PS2 is the game are very cheap compared to new releases. I just got 3 big title games from half.com for $20, one-third of the price of a new PS3, 360, Wii, and soon to be PC game. And to top it off, there's no DLC's that you have to pay extra for. PS2 games are the full game; no playing for 5 hours then having to wait for DLC to play more. Also, you don't have to worry about playing extra to unlock a used game or have a constant internet connection.

I know some of my examples of DRM and DLC are for a few games, but that's the way the PC market is going, and DLC's for short games are common for consoles. I think, because of these reasons, if you're not liking the way things are going, buy a PS2. 

**tl;dr:** PS2 &gt; PC/Consoles today, amirite?",gaming
Anyone else miss the days where people couldn't easily contact game developers?,"Operation Logic Bomb.


You know how long it took me to beat that game? I bought it at a Garage sale when I was 10. I beat it it when I was 21. Granted, I didn't spend the whole time playing it and there was an interim period where I stuck the game in a box for some 7-ish years, but my point is this:

Back when I was a kid, some games were unfair. You picked up a game like Operation Logic Bomb and take it home, pop it into the console and realized with growing animosity that the game was BRUTALLY unfair. Enemies that shoot everywhere, no save points, very little health packs.. But the game was fun. 

Nowadays when a fun game has what is deemed to be an unfair learning curve, or something else people don't like, they constantly spam the developers with emails, petitions, phone calls, by the hundreds due to the fact that the people who has the smallest gripes can band together on the internet.

Okay, granted, some things require developer attention. some games HAVE broken aspects. 

But therein lies the glory. If people weren't so easily able to contact the developers, and if games today weren't so easy to update from the game developer's HQ, devs would be more pressured to make sure it works the first time.

Back to my point.

When I was a child, if a game was too hard, you just tried harder. You didn't amass a group on the internet to email the game developers to ""make it more fair"", you sat your butt down, set the living room TV to tape your favorite show, and you put some more effort into it. You learned how to play the game BETTER.

 Granted, I started my gaming life on the NES and I KNOW that to some that alone sounds like i'm a newbie. Those of you who started on Atari, intellivision, hell even magnavox, seriously, good on ya. More power to ya.

Maybe you also can agree that the public, in many cases, has way too much room to attempt to alter games. This sonic4 petition is just one small example of public/developer communication privileges being abused. 

Listen up: Sonic 4 is NOT your game. It is sega's game. If you don't want to buy it, fine. Sega doesn't care. I want to buy it. Most of my friends want to buy it. All you're doing with your petitions is showing yourselves to be ignorant and self-promoting, and unwilling to accept that you are not part of the video game creation process.

Grow up. If you don't like the game, don't buy it.

And if you think a game is too hard, put some effort into it.

I'm probably half way through Bad Company 2 single player and I absolutely love it. And here is why,"Going to first say that I am a pre-order-er and well, I needed my fix and it's the damn weekend. I played the multiplayer beta quite a bit. I am going to try and keep this spoiler free as much as I can. 

The very beginning I was worried due to the ww2 bullshit (we are all sick of it I know) but trust me when I say that you shouldn't be worried about it.

The game is fun. That is the number one reason. There is nothing better than the feeling you get when you use your grenade launcher to make your own doorway in the back of the building, and this goes for both single and multiplayer.

It's actually funny, and doesn't take it's self seriously what so ever. I didn't play BC1 due to it being console only, so I don't know what those people are used to, but this game is actually funny at times, I never once thought in my head ""omg that would never happen nerd rage nerd rage"" You will see what I mean when you see the helicopter pilot. And if silly things like that bother you, then all I have to say is shut up and just enjoy the game.

The characters are memorable.

There are alot of ""wow, that was really fun, let's do that again!"" moments in this game. I have yet to get to a part that really bothers me. Due to this game being sandbox I always find ways to make every part of the game fun. Did I mention that you can make your own doorways?

SOUND! Sound in bc2 is amazing. Sure it doesn't have hans zimmer fucking master music man making music, but it has really amazing gun sounds and ambient noises. And one thing I noticed in multiplayer is that all the players are making the war ambiance. I'm not sure if that is true in all games, but BC2 does such a damn good job that it makes you feel like you are actually there. No pre generated ""oh shit I'm in a war"" noises, just players using guns and you hear them in the distance. It's amazing.

If you have to compare MW2 with BC2, even though they are apples and oranges. MW2 is a girlfriend you have to beg for sex, and when you get it, it's amazing but you are craving more and have to go through more work. BC2 is a girlfriend who cooks you a steak and blows you while watching 24. 

And multiplayer.. MW2, deathmatch with instagib guns ad grind. BC2 battlefield type gameplay with buildings you can make your own doorways!! Awesome maps (well just the one I have seen) where you can plow down absolutely everything.

If you even like parts of red faction you will appreciate this game due to sandbox. 

If you like battlefield games, you will be a little upset with missing prone, but shut up and have fun.

If you like MW2, you will like this game. Hell you may end up loving it.

If you like not having fun, then fuck off",gaming

I just completed Mirror's Edge based on the recommendation of Reddit. Here are my counterpoints to Yahtzee's review.,"I bought Mirror's Edge on the recommendation of Reddit. I feel obliged to tell Reddit briefly, what I thought of the game.

I feel that Yahtzee's criticism of the game was spot on, but not nearly as major as he's made out. There are times during the game you will stare at a wall, but usually when climbing up one via drain pipe or brute jumping force. If you spent more than a few seconds staring a wall, you're doing it wrong! The game has clever environments which you're supposed to exploit - not try to brute force your way through! 

The storyline lacked any development of the bad guys, as Yahtzee also pointed out. But the storyline isn't about bringing the government down - that's the mcguffin. The storyline is about Kate, and her setup. Sure it's devious but it's actually quite enjoyable. 

The balance of fighting (if you choose to engage it) and parkour is also well tuned. Mirror's Edge's learning curve is not difficult (not beyond thirty minutes) if you're used to WASD based games. The game graphically glistens to a shine, and is very compelling. You are easily sucked into the dynamics of the game.

One of the best games I wish I played sooner. Also the first game I've completed in 10 years and 1 month (since Ocarina of Time). Mirror's Edge does not outstay it's welcome; in this respect it is similar to Portal. An idea, executed beautifully but short and not boring. If you haven't purchased this game, it is seriously a must buy. You'll make time to play this game. It is worth the pittance for the 6-15 hours you will get out of it.

PS: Do not play it on a console. You lose 50% of it's value immediately.",gaming

Reddit: Help me find a space-empire game that I can enjoy.,"I used to play Celetania - but they closed their doors at the end of last month, and since then I have been looking for something to fill the void. I made a trial account on eve a few days ago but its just not the same. Its fun and stuff, but it just dosen't feel like a 'space empire' sort of game. Celetania was just that, you started out as a ruler of your own planet, moving onward to colonize space, controlling systems. I liked the concept, it was great. Eve just dosen't have that same feel to it. I'm liking eve -- but I'm not sure if I want to put money down on it just yet. It really dosen't feel like a 'space empire' game at all to me. Not at all.

So help me out reddit, help me find a new space empire game. Some basic prerequisites:

* Standalone Client, PC game. NO BROWSER GAMES.
* 3d. Please? I'd like half decent visuals. Nothing ground breaking but, 3d would be nice.
* Pay to play preferred with a trial option. Item shop game would be acceptable but not preferred.
* I am the emperor of my own space empire. Preferably from the start.
* Continuous play environment (not required but really preferred).

"Dear /r/Gaming, I come to you asking for repair advice...","Around three weeks ago, my 60GB PS3 got the YLOD. A problem that plagues almost exclusively the first-generation (read: backwards compatibible, good generation) machines.

Upon examining the support site I discover that *of course* I'm out of warranty. But I could send it in to Sony to be repaired for the low low cost of $145.

No thanks.

So, I do some research. I'm a fairly handy guy. Build computers and stuff. So I read up on the whole YLOD thing, and discover that it's due either to a power supply overheat/malfunction or a mainboard overheat.

Cool.

I buy a new power supply off the eBay. No dice. So, it's a mainboard problem. This means that I could either replace the thermal paste, or replace the thermal paste and try to ""reflow"" the processors - that is, remelt the soldering material so that they stick more flush and firm to the board.

So, I reapply thermal paste first. No sense in buying a heat gun if I'm not going to need it.

Unfortunately, this would prove to be a bad idea.

I don't know if it was the cheap silicone thermal, or if it was something else, but when I tested my repair, I still got the YLOD. Then I turned it off, waited a few minutes, and tried again.

Reddit, if you could have seen my face, you would probably have laughed. A small ""pop"" issued from the case, and the smell of smoke started to waft up.

Panicking, I took the machine to the bathroom and set it in the tub. If this thing was going to start on fire, I wanted water as close by as I could get it.

No fire. No water.

Cautiously, I make my way through the case again, until I get down to the board. On the edge, about two inches from the RSX and Cell cores, is a tiny blown resistor and something else I'm not sure I could identify. But the point is, the system is not looking good.

So, at this point I have three options:  
• Buy a new motherboard off the internet, try to replace damaged components. I have never soldered items before.  
• Pay for the ridiculous cost to repair/refurb my machine. Lose all game saves/downloaded video.  
• Buy a new, slim PS3. Less risk of YLOD in the future. Lose all game saves/downloaded video, lose backwards compatibility.

Your thoughts?

Is there anything  can do about this?,"So my WoW account got hacked recently, and the hacker added a month of game time to the account (i was not playing when it was hacked). So i've been happily playing enjoying talking to all of my WoW friends again, and just this morning the account has been banned.


Apparently a complaint was filed against the accounts last payment.


&gt;This dispute was filed by the bank, credit card provider, or financial institution associated with the payment on the account. As a result of this dispute, funds paid on the account were withdrawn from Blizzard Entertainment. This is known as a ""chargeback"".

^ Direct quote from the email blizz sent.


The total withdrawn was $14.99 the price of the one month the hacker had added.
Now my account is in negative balance with blizzard. Until the account has been payed back the money i am unable to use it at all.


What REALLY pisses me off is that i was really enjoying playing so i had just bought another game card to continue playing. There is also the fact that blizzard KNOWS my account was hacked, but i am still the one who is going to have to foot the bill to continue playing.


TL;DR WoW account got hacked, hacker added time to account, i start playing again, pay $40 for another game card, hackers payment to account is withdrawn, account is now inactive until i pay blizzard $15.",gaming

Another scary evolutionary game idea.,"Picture this: a free, open-source (at least the game-engine-itself part, more later) multiplayer RPG/combat game. Very generic as released. 

However, it's not completely free - it has a pay-to-play model. Far cheaper than WoW or anything - just enough, if a server gets mildly popular, to cover the hosting fees. 

And herein lies core idea #1: *It pays its own way*. Fees from players are paid directly to the server host, automatically. And if there's a big enough fee surplus, it *automatically* rents and spawns another server. 

Core idea #2: Anyone can submit updates, patches, tweaks or new content (for the game engine, not the financial side) to the repository. New patches get automatically downloaded, installed and evaluated. If revenue increases as a result, the server keeps the patch and upvotes it in the repo, making it more likely to be adopted by new or existing instances. Decreases get downvotes, and anything with a very low score simply gets deleted. And a small percentage of the increased fees go to the submitter for some period of time. 

Yes, MLM, in game form. 

And core idea #3: the game trades a little advertising space for referrals. The more referrals, the more your ads get shown - unless people start quitting because of them. 

Give it five years, and sheer selection pressure will produced have the most ruthlessly, exploitatively addicting gameplay possible.",gaming

Hey /r/gaming - I'm thinking of buying a Sennheiser PC 350 headset ever since my other headset broke. Can anyone help out in my decision making process?,"Some information:

I'm looking for comfort, sound quality, and especially build quality. I put my headsets through hell (not on purpose) and most of them don't live to see the next day. Granted, I have started to not place my headsets on my chair anymore, but I would still like good quality.


So far most of the things I'm looking for are found in Sennheiser's PC 350 headset. If the decision is made to buy it, I'd get it from Amazon for around 97$ with shipping, so price isn't really a concern.


I have one main question, however... I have this sound card, and while it's pretty good, I'm wondering if it could handle the 150 ohms that the headset has. 


If it can't, I do have a logitech x-540 speaker system that has a direct headphone jack for listening, and I'm guessing this method has a much larger chance of working. So if the previous option doesn't work, does this one? And if this method works, can the microphone cord extend itself a few feet without being closely attached to the audio cord?

"Hey Gaming Reddit, software I wrote detects trending topics in gaming, thought you might be interested.","It's called Pulse

It's at the point where I would class it as ""not terrible"" so I thought I'd share it with you all. It's part of a site I'm building called Wire.vg that's basically a cross between Reddit Gaming (which I love) and Google Reader (which I used to love, before I ended up adding too many feeds and it got overwhelming).

Anyway, Pulse (see, it's like a ""pulse"" of news going down the ""wire"", geddit?) uses Wire.vg's news scraper (known internally as the Feed Fetching Script or FFS) to get all the posts from all the big gaming sites. Then it works out which words and phrases are being talked about more today than in the past few days and uses the site's search function to try to get news relating to that phrase. Finally it uses on-site voting to order the results (though as the site's tiny, the voting's a bit meh).

I'm sure for the vast majority of Reddit Gaming users this is probably not all that useful a thing to have, but for the minority who like nerdy toys (like me), I thought I would share :)

Fallout 3 Mods and Textures,"Sorry if this is the wrong area to post this in.  I couldn't find a Fallout 3 sub and this is my first post.

Anyway, I just bought Fallout 3 for $25 during the recent Steam sale.  I modded the shit out of Oblivion and it looked and ran beautifully.  The textures in Fallout 3 are disgusting so I'm trying to install the HD texture packs.  Since this is my first play through, I don't want to use any game changing mods (except killable children, and VATS Normal Weapon Degradation), just texture packs.

Here's a list of the ones I have installed in the load order set by FOMM:

* The Unofficial Fallout 3 Patch
* Darnified UI
* Darnified UI Extras
* VATS Normal Weapon Degradation
* Enhanced Blood Textures
* Inebriation
* Item Descriptions
* Hi-Res Weapons &amp; Ammo Textures
* Hi-Res Weapons &amp; Ammo Textures - The Pitt
* Killable Kids

Texture Packs:

* [NMC's Rocks Addon]
* Better Litter
* Books Debunked
* Enhanced Blood Textures
* Enhanced Night Sky
* Essentials Retex Vol 1
* Essentials Retex Vol 2
* Essentials Retex Vol 3
* Fallout 3 HD Pack
* Fallout 3 Item Descriptions
* Hi-Res Armor Textures
* Hi-Res Historical Documents
* Hi-Res Lunchbox
* Hi-Res Skill Books
* Hi-Res Vault Door Panels Repack
* Hi-Res Weapons &amp; Ammo Textures
* Hi-Res Books
* NMC Megaton Texture Pack 
* NMC Rivet City Texture Pack
* New Clutter
* New Furniture
* Parkerized Pipboy w/ Pipboy Glove
* Subtle Sunglare FX
* NMC Terrain Pack

All of the packs are the highest available resolution when there's an option.

Computer Specs:

* Phenom X4 9750 (2.4Ghz)
* 4GB DDR2
* Sapphire 1GB 4850 (stock clocks)
* Windows 7 x64

I've also gone through Tweakguide's ini tweaks.  The game ran great after the ini tweaks.  Unfortunately, I was in Megaton while adding the texture packs so I wasn't testing them fully when I would load up the game after each package I installed.

When I disable the NMC Rocks Addon (8192x8192), I can get a little farther out into the wasteland before the game crashes.  This makes me think I'm running out of VRAM.

I would really like some help with this.  Has anyone else been able to get all the texture packs working?  Does anyone know of a program that displays VRAM usage for ATi cards in Windows 7?

I don't imagine my load order is a problem since it's mainly just texture packs which should just override earlier textures when you install them.  I can't imagine this game filling up my VRAM but I can't think of what else it would be.

I'll edit this later to add links to those lists.  Also, I'd like to keep this post around and hope it morphs into a proper resource and possibly a guide to make Fallout 3 look it's best.

EDIT: NeilMC has released a new compilation mod with all his old textures along with some optimization tweaks and stuff.  Check it out here.  I'm gonna mess around with it and then continue adding links later.",gaming
"It's Called Regular Fighter: a 2D Fighting Game With Digitized (MK 1, 2, and 3 Style) of Everyday People Fighting Each Other","I've had this idea since i was a kid. A cast of perhaps fifty people, digitized precisely old-school Mortal Kombat style, featuring all the regular joes and school girls and jock fourteen year olds you've ever met. There'd be a school janitor, a high school basketball player, a skater, a conservative, a liberal, a cop, a doctor, a black guy, a white guy, some mexicans, etc. They would, of course, have strange and impractical movements in their stances (think Cyrax's absurd ready stance from MK3.)  They'd all have weapons (actually let's say you can choose from a large number of weapons) who also come from the realm of the everyday. the basketball player would have a ball, janitor a large broom, cop a night stick, there'd be machete, maybe, but basically instruments you've always wanted to swing into another person in a 2D fighter. the weapons, of course, would be just a bit more damaging than punches and kicks. It is a game born in the throes of a day-long sustained ADHD daydream.
It would be a comedic experience as well as an ADHD catharsis. Is there any way i could do this for cheap? but i'm also throwing this out there: if anyone anywhere can make this, make it, don;t make it, borrow an idea or don't. I just want to see this game some day.",gaming
What MMORPGs are out there which allow just free killing and looting of other players?,"Back in the days of MUD-ding, I used to play on a Wheel of Time server called The Creator's Shadow.  (MUDs are pre-cursors to games like WoW for you kids).  The game allowed for looting of equipment and gold which created some interesting game play at times.  You couldn't loot inside safe zones and you couldn't loot someone who was so many levels below you but when in effect, it made for some interest scenarios.

People tended to stick with guilds or clans purely for the safety aspect of not getting looted.  If someone did, and you were in the right guild, that person would be tracked down and dealt with.  Also, it created a feeling of danger at every map.  My friend actually became a Robin Hood thief of sorts, attacking only the richest individuals and stealing gold to give back to the poorest players.  Really good times

Anyone know of a MMORPG that allows this kind of free style looting?  It's been watered down over the years to the point where you both have to agree to fight or have flags attached, etc..  It's not quite the same unless you can attack ANYONE regardless of situation.",gaming

Star Ocean 3, 4

Skies of Arcadia

Tales of Symphonia, Abyss, Vesperia

Baldur's Gate

Planescape: Torment

Fallout 3

Elder Scrolls 3, 4

Currently playing and enjoying Wild Arms 1 and Dragon Quest 4

---

I've played and NOT enjoyed:
Final Fantasy 8, 12, 13 

8 felt like the story was an afterthought. The entire party supposedly being raised together at the same orphanage and ""forgetting"" until 3/4 of the game really kind of was my ""fuck this"" moment of the game. 

12 I loathed the main character. I just couldn't stand him, and whenever he was in a cutscene I usually wanted to punch him in the face for how he acted. I also disliked the system of upgrading (License) as it was apparently random. Gambits were novel at first but then made the combat in the game somewhat boring for me. I disliked how your influence was small in the world. Also: Fuck whoever made the demon-doors in this game.

13 I hated the entire on-rail feel of the game, lack of ability to explore, and lack of world immersion. I felt nothing for the world. I never visited any towns, talked to any people, or did anything that might let me feel a tiny bit attached to anyplace on the globe. I also strongly disliked Vanille as a character (in addition to her voice actor's reading of her lines), and Hope was grating for the first half of the game. I disliked how your influence was small in the world.

Wild Arms 4. Every character you ever meet with a name, or begin to care about dies horribly onscreen.](/spoiler) I don't know why they did this, but at the end of the game I felt worse for playing it. A little tragedy is good. But damn, come on. Give me a little bit of a break. [You even make me watch my mom die and then make me kill my own dad who makes it clear he cares about me and THEN act cheery about it after to other people who have no idea what happened. Followed by an ending where the game informs you survivors of the game died, and the main character became a hermit in the woods.

Tales of Symphonia 2. I actually enjoyed elements of this game, but removal of free-roaming hurt it a great deal for me. I dislike selecting a town to visit and then being there. I like running around and looking at things.


-----

Now with these things in mind, and explanations of reasons I didn't like some of the games, any suggestions would be great. I don't mind finding older titles or exclusives to consoles. I just want to play a good story with good gameplay, hopefully with some of my examples listed providing my perspective of what that is. :)

Im hoping one of you will at least have the faintest idea what game im trying to remember!,"I used to play this game years ago on my nans old windows 98 pc.

It was some sort of safari simulator, and i think it was to do with photography, although i never got that far (because i was about 8, and didnt know what i was doing)

You start of outside a building, and then you go inside and can walk around all of the rooms, and in one there is lots of shelves and a guy in the middle who says some stuff to you. Also there was a fly on one of the shelves or somewhere, and you could click on it and it would fly around the room with you seeing through tis eyes.

Also there was an alice in wonderland reference with a cake or something saying ""eat me"" and then you shrunk, and you could get back to normal size by drinking a bottle with ""drink me"" written on it.

When you got outside, to the back of the building there was a jeep you could drive up to a gate and i could never get out of it.

I hope one of you knows the game im on about, and could remember it?

Thanks in advance!",gaming

Bioshock 2. Why all the hate? (possible spoilers),"I hated this game for a long time after it came out.  Massive expectations for what I thought would be an art piece as amazing as the original were ready for the taking last February.

But, instead I got a terrible POS with fucked up fov's and bugs, a game that was unplayable by people that are colorblind (i'm not, but it's a principle). I was upset with 2k and the release overall. 

But all that aside, a patch was released, I played the game, and found myself rather floored.  I had read so much negative review about the game itself and I wasn't sure where it was coming from. 

I just happened on this link and it elicits genuine emotional reaction from me, something that I want from games.

While Bioshock 1 is amazing, and well done and all of that, it's a plot twist game, with really a rather consolish boss in my opinion.  I didn't want a boss for Bioshock 1, I wanted Rapture.  I wanted Rapture to be my nemesis, I wanted it to crush me and fall apart and leak and fold onto me and for me to somehow escape it. But instead I got some freak mutant to fight in some formulaic battle. Bioshock 2 was different, I had purpose, drive, need to do something and same something. It's my daughter after all right? It doesn't need a lot of explanation the connection is there, which may be cheap, but at least there was a stake. In Bioshock 1 I had no reasons, no purpose, no drive to anything I did, I was bamboozled, by the game itself and the plot of the game as well. 

So I have to know, why did people specifically dislike Bioshock 2 (and no mentioning of the multiplayer, I don't even know why it was there)?",gaming

One question about the new Kirby.,Why is everyone jizzing about it. Kirby is all about taking powers and using them.

/r/gaming ! I need your help identifying a game from my childhood!,"When I was around seven or eight, one of my friends had this weird-ass FPS that he would play constantly. Something reminded me of it recently, and I've been hopelessly asking around to figure out what it was called. The thing is, I only remember certain aspects of it, and anything about the game I describe sounds like total lunacy.

We played the game on an old G3 iMac (this was around '99/2000). I remember that the player was fighting some kind of aliens that bled green when you shot them. Between levels, there was this weird bonus stage where you'd try to shoot a garbage can with legs for an extra life while flying around in a vortex. I am not making this shit up.
I also remember that the battle with the final boss (some kinda huge alien) involved feeding it seals. And then calling in a dog to fight it or something. 

I honestly have nothing else to go by to find this game, so if anyone recognizes it or has any info, please help out!

What are some games that you think are wholly underrated?,"For me, it's the minority report game for the ps2, xbox and gamecube.
I had hours of fun with this game.  The protagonist was unique and interesting (not tom cruise) the fighting was a blast, and it was one of the first games to use ragdoll physics (and they took FULL advantage of that technology)

They made the game fun by making it difficult to take on a lot of guys, so you'd be fighting maybe like, 5 at once, but if you were smart you could strategize your fighting to keep them all at arms length.

There's nothing quite better then picking up a guy by his collar, throwing him forward and then blasting him with your concussion gun up into the air and over a balcony where he then falls into a glass billboard, shattering it into a thousand pieces.

Here's a video of this awesome game no one gave a fuck about.  It got reviewed so harshly back then too (an average of 2 stars!)

Thoughts on OnLive from someone who has never owned a proper gaming rig.,"I just got an invite to OnLive and I thought I would post a little review of what I have seen thus far. Now ive never owned a true gaming computer, the best graphics card ive ever had is the one that is in my 3 year old laptop, here are the stats just for comparisons sake:


    ThinkPad T61
    2.2Ghz C2D
    4GB PC5400
    Nvidia Nvs 140m (128MB dedicated)
    yadda yadda yadda


Now this thing can handle most newish games, it can play crysis at native res on minimums with a decent frame rate, I don't really know how it would compare to most modern rigs in any way whatsoever but it suits my needs. Now for my connection I have Qwest VDSL at about 6.6Mbit down .75Mbit up.


Alright, now to the actual onlive service, the main interface didnt really win me over it seems too clunky when compared to something like steam, like they are putting too much emphasis on the interface and ""social"" aspects of the games rather than the games themselves. The loading is insanely fast, i started with Just Cause 2, because I am quite familiar with the Xbox version, this is where i noticed the only real example of  input lag with the grapple it would lag and i wouldnt hit my target graphics were quite good there was some compression artifacts but nothing too bad considering this laptop could in no way normally handle this game.


Next i went on to UT3, this game i own on steam and have played quite a bit, i didnt notice any input lag at all and the graphics were massively better than what my laptop can do (normally medium-low), there were again some compression artifacts, but only a perfectionist would be put off by them. The game went silky smooth, and if i end up keeping this service i will definitely be playing this on onlive instead of steam.


The Biggest thing about this service is there is almost no load time, you click a game and its up, main menu ready to go no waiting at all, this was mind boggleing to me. The perfect scenario for me would be if steam buys up OnLive and then you have every steam game up for either download, or playing it live instantly, this would be gaming bliss. I'll try to get some screenshots up later after ive tried it out some more.",gaming
Two secret upcoming Valve projects.,"In Seattle I do volunteer work with a Valve employee.  Whenever I get the chance, I chat him up about the company and what they've done.  I thanked him and Valve for what they did with CS:S (although I can leave the kill cam).

I also ofcourse asked some questions about Episode 3, and he told me that the reason why it's not being developed as much, is because compared to every game they've released, the episodes have sold and been played the least.  They will release it in the future, but there is of course nothing announced.  He couldn't say much which I understood.  While Valve is an excellent company, they do still have to worry about their bottom line, and at the moment, Episode 3 will not make them much of a profit.

I talked to him about Portal 2, and then talked about Tag which was made by some students at Digipen, and those students were hired by valve to work on Portal 2.

**He then told me that valve is working on two separate projects, one will be announced in a month or two, and one is super top secret, and they've been working on it for a while.  The most interesting thing he said, as he couldn't say much, was that both of these projects were genres that they've never done before, and will be completely different.  I asked RTS, he said no**

subhazard is full of shit. here's what valve is really up to...,"throwaway account, obviously. i don't want to get in trouble for this

firstly, my contact at valve has told me that Subhazard is full of shit

secondly, i have some information

Subhazard was almost right in his assumptions about episode 3. it has not been a priority at valve but not because people don't play it but because valve is working on a couple of other projects and episode 3 will serve as a teaser for a big new project, one of which is half life 4 (the episodes are referred to as half life 3 in house by gabe and doug)

half life 4 will run on a new engine dubbed internally as ""re-source"". it is basically source with all the new stuff from episodes 1 and 2 (character modelling and animation etc) with a new graphical front-end to bring it up to par with crysis and a bit beyond considering the physics of the worlds they will create

for example, the new tools (hammer is being left behind) operate more like garry's mod in that game objects are created of individual moving parts wired together instead of whole objects (a car is wheels, and engine and some wiring instead of a box that moves forward and backward and animates like its wheels are turning)

the engine is backwards compatible, making it easy to port existing source titles to the new engine, and runs purely on opengl and some middleware valve has been working on internally (this will help it run out of the gate on mac, linux and windows)

there will be a new version of l4d that combines 1 and 2 with the new engine and it will be part of a ""box"" that will launch with hl4.

the new counter strike (internally cs2, viewing cs and css as the same game) is like a cross between cs, cod4 and tf2. instead of just buying weapons at the start of a round players can also buy ""perks"" (more like specialty items like boots and laser sights that grant quiet running and improved accuracy, etc). buying weapons is more like buying a class with pre-defined kits to help streamline in-game roles and aid new players and they come at a discount (players can also buy weapons individually but it's a bit more expensive)

game types include de and cs but also cp (control point) and es (escape). control point works like tf2 where there are multiple points to capture, however it's much quicker and there is no respawning and not every point needs to be capped (e.g. dustbowl, you wouldn't need a and b to cap c, just need to get a or b to open up c). escape is more like traditional deathmatch with one steam starting at the end of the map and one in the middle and one team must make it to an extraction point

also, valve is working on an rts/rpg like dota but it's more of a hobby/curiosity project atm instead of a major title (like portal was for the orange box)

tl;dr, new multi-platform engine based on source that is prettier and more complete is being developed for half life 4. episode 3 (final chapter of half life 3) is being worked on as the teaser for a big announcement. a new counter strike is in the works and valve has a funky new rpg/rts project in the works. all will launch simultaneously on windows, mac and linux.",gaming

Good luck and godspeed.

Also, if you already have the game or can shell out the $4, it'd be great if you gave others the chance to play this magnificent game. :)

Should I upgrade with this Newegg deal?,"I wasn't sure whether to post this in gaming or AskReddit, but I settled on here. As you may or may not have seen, newegg's shellshocker deal today is for a Geforce gt 240 with 1Gb DDR3. I've been looking out for upgrades for awhile since my current rig is older than dirt, relatively speaking. I recently shelled out for a 1TB HDD that I installed ubuntu on, but before that everything was on my old 80 gig hard drive. However, I'm ridiculously incompetent at comparing things, so after about an hour of looking online, I've decided to defer to reddit for advice. My current card is a GeForce 8600 GTS that I've had for quite awhile. It's a bit buggy and prone to overheating, but I've fixed that with a ghetto cooling system consisting of a wall-fan blowing air directly into the open face of my case. It's served me well enough but it's starting to chug on the newer games unless I run them on pretty low settings. I'm not an intense gamer, but I'm definitely getting Diablo III when it comes out and there will surely be other games I want, so I need to know whether the gt 240 is a decent upgrade over what I have, and whether or not it will last me for a year or two before another upgrade. Unfortunately, as I said before, I am not hardware savvy enough to know, especially since this is the GDDR3 gt 240 as opposed to the GDDR5 model. I appreciate any help given.",gaming

"Reddit, help me figure out what game has been haunting me since the 90s","UPDATE: 
Rapidwire is my hero! The game was Azreal's Tear. Thanks everyone, my mind is at peace now. 

For 10 years I have been trying to identify a PC game I played in the 90s. The problem is that my memory is flaky, and that the details I remember might not be entirely accurate anymore. The game has taken on a dreamlike quality in my mind, but I know it's real. 

By accident in an American bookstore, I bought what I think was the UK version of PC Gamer. There was an article inside about the development of a game that seemed ahead of its time.  The article title might have had the word ""rose"" in it. The game was played in first person, and I think there might have been dinosaurs. And no, it was not Turok. The game was being developed by some European company, possibly French. The graphics tech felt vaguely like Quake (which I don't think has come out yet): rendered shadows, photorealistic texture mapping, polygonal characters. The overall look was dark, desaturated, and moody.  

The magazine came with a game demos disk that included a playable version of the game. I tried it out. The only part I remember clearly is entering some type of cavelike room with wooden spears sticking out of the ground. The overall mood of the space was lonely and foreboding. 

As this was a demo, I don't even know if they full game was ever finished or released. 

Does anyone have any idea what game this was? It's driving me bonkers.",gaming

Right now I am playing FF:T v1.3 on my psp and it is really an amazing mod for the game, but I am having trouble finding that next game I want to play. Nowadays I tend to lean more towards handheld games (I have a DS/psp/gba) so those would be the preferable systems to play the games on. I tried Jean'd'arc(sp?) on the psp and I can't recall exactly what it was, but the game just didn't have ""it"" for me.

"Why you got kicked from Left 4 Dead (2), or any other FPS for that matter.","One of the most frequent complaints I see from new L4D (2) or FPS players is general is that they are kicked from games with little/no explanation. 

Or sometimes they acknowledge that it is because they haven't learned how to be good at that game yet, but argue that they cannot get good unless people let them play, catch 22.

So here is why players are often kicked, and what is expected from players in order to avoid being kicked.

As a quick disclaimer, I avoid kicking players just for being inexperienced and try to politely tell them what they need to do.

This may come off as snobbish and elitist, and it quite possibly is. But it is entirely realistic.

**What is expected of you**

* That you have fully completed the single player campaign(s) at normal difficulty. This is regarded as entry-level practice for multi-player. Alternatively, try the Easy campaigns in multiplayer with more experienced friends who will guide you through.

* That you know your way around the map including appropriate weapon/ammo stashes and short-cuts. You should never be 'lost' or unable to find your way to a target.

* That you can still navigate a map in adverse conditions such as being covered in boomer bile.

* That you are familiar with which weapons work well in different situations. E.g. shotguns for nearby targets, rifles for medium-long range targets.

* To use voice chat and communicate effectively. Saying ""I'm over here"" helps nobody. You should always elaborate if you need something.

* Knowing when to give instructions, and when to follow instructions.

* To keep up with the group, or let the group know if you are unable to do so.

* Join games of the appropriate skill level. If you are finding a normal game too hard, then do yourself and the other players a favour by joining easy games until you improve.

* To speak the same language as the majority of the team. If you're good at working in a team by interpreting the other players actions then this isn't so important - but good all the same.

* That you have read the latest news posts when updates are released so you are familiar with any changes.

* If you are joining Advanced games, at least 24 hours of logged game time is expected in order to have sufficient experience.

* Expert games, at least 72 hours.

* Team games, at least 100 hours.


**What you shouldn't do**

* Insult other players.

* Run off ahead and insult players for not keeping up.

* Get lost and insult players for going to fast.

* Play music over the mic.

* Use auto-talk. We don't want to hear your siblings/so/parents talking in the background. Always use Push-to-talk.

* Join a game if you know in advance that you don't have enough time to complete it.

* Join a game if you know that your computer is particularly unstable and liable to crash or die during a game. Try a game in single player first if you have been having problems recently.

* Ragequit and leave your team-mates hanging.

* Refuse to comply with the groups wishes. If 3 of them want to go one way, you should do the same.

* Attack on your own as infected (unless there is a major obvious advantage) as you'll likely be killed too fast to do any major damage. Try to coordinate with a team mate to split up or disorientate enemies first.

Crysis ill-optimized or insanely out of it's league?,"I recently bought the Crysis Maximum edition package, namely for the MechWarrior Living Legends mod, but I felt compelled to play through the campaign. First off, let me say that it is hard, and this is the rig I'm running it on.

OS: Windows 7 x64

CPU: AMD Phenom II X4 Black Edition

RAM: 4 Gigs 

Video: ATI Radeon HD 5770 with a gig of GDDR5

PSU: 585 Watts

Monitor: 23'' 16:9 (at 1680 x 900 as opposed to native 1920x1080 for crysis gameplay)

At the normal ""High"" settings, with everything just on high, I get around 20-30 fps, and it drops when in major combat scenes. (Note: I do tend to play with guns blazing and jumping on buildings, as opposed to cloaking everywhere).

INSANELY disappointed with the performance, I did some research and found that the performance is actually what I should be getting. Lame.

So my next brilliant idea was to turn everything, everything, to low and off. Started the game up, and I got a resounding, wait for it...

10 frames per second better performance. I tested it in the same sequence, too. 

I know Crysis Warhead is supposed to run better, but what the hell?! I'm infuriated! When I'm just walking through jungles, it looks amazing, but otherwise I just get mad!

I understand the game is supposed to benchmark and push the boundaries, but I would think they'd have an ""optimized"" mode that would tone things down for good framerates! It's annoying because I've seen WAY less capable rigs run crysis at lowest settings around the same performances.

My vote is for ill-optimized.",gaming

Singularity review (my copy is for PS3),"Alright, I've played Singularity all the way through, twice and I'd like to write a mini-review of it, because I think this game deserves way more exposure than it has been getting.

Overall this game has been similar to Bioshock, but *a lot more fun* in terms of gameplay for me personally.  While the levels in Singularity are not all that open, they seem to be a bit more open than claustrophobic corridor-like mess we find in Bioshock.  At the same time, the TMD (time manipulation device) is a lot more interesting to me than the plasmids.

The story is just there.  It's not horrible, but it's not great either.  None of the characters really touch me emotionally and nothing happens that I find interesting or thought-provoking, like say in the movie Matrix, or in Deus Ex.

The graphics seem to be decent.  They aren't in my favorite style.  My favorite style is a crisp, clean, perfect-looking Metal Gear Solid look.  This game has more of a bright and slightly smudgy water-color style graphics.  It's very good, competent and detailed and I am sure a lot of people will probably prefer it to something overly clean and crisp.  The graphics style in this game is very similar to Bioshock in my opinion.

I found *no bugs* in this game.  That's very good!  We can't say this about Just Cause 2, for example, which was buggy as hell.

The manual that comes with this game is 2 pages of shit and feels cheap and stupid.  Raven could have done a lot better with the manual.

Gameplay time is on the short side for my liking.  It's about 15 hours for your first play-through, which is not terribly bad, but I expect a lot more from games.  On the second play-through, it's a lot shorter, since you remember a lot of things and there are fewer surprises.

Not all cut-scenes can be skipped, but none of them have been so long that I was desperate to skip them even on the second play-through.

The weapons are interesting and the TMD is a very good game mechanic.  I really enjoyed the gameplay, and I wished the game delivered twice the amount of content for the price.

The sound and music felt solid and competent to me.

I tried multiplayer, but it was at night, and the game couldn't get the required 6 players to start a round, so I quit.  I don't think there are enough people with the game to make multi-player fun.

Overall this game is so sadly **underrated**.  Sure, this game is not the best, but no way is this game worse than Bioshock 2 or HalfLife 2.  No way.  It is sad and unjust that this game is not getting more buzz.  I think this game is worth a solid 30-40 dollars for most shooter fans, and the most die-hard fans who loved Bioshock 2 and HalfLife should feel free to shell out the full 60 bucks for it, if they don't mind a shortish single-player campaign.

Do yourself a favor and check this game out.  You should at the very least rent this game.",gaming
Civ IV... worth it for a non-RTS fan?,"Ok, here's the deal. I have heard nothing but good things from you guys about Civ IV (""BUY IT NAO"" ""You will not sleep for days"" ""When you finally take a break in September let me know what you think"", etc.). And now it's on sale on Steam for $10.

The only thing is that I am not a fan of RTS's, and I never have been. I have just never enjoyed them. So I'm **extremely** hesitant to drop $10 on something that I might not like. 

So should I do it? I feel like I should give it a shot, but $10 is kind of a stretch for me right now (broke recent HS graduate) so I don't want to waste my money. 

Thanks in advance!

"I've been awake since my birthday party 4 days ago. I played HL2, episode 1, and episode 2 in that time. I swear I saw and heard headcrabs on my way in to work this morning.","In fact, I've been in my office, alone, for the last hour or so. I am almost certain there are combine soldiers with bad AI waiting outside my door, but I'm all out of grenades.

When I started my scooter, it sounded like I was charging my HEV suit. I was worried my scooter was broken.

I used the wrong keypass on the door when I got here (I have separate passes for whether I'm doing graves or daytime work), and instead of the usual error beep, it sounded like the noise it makes when you try to use a med charger that's empty. I began to worry about how I was going to get to the next one alive.

Totally worth it.

EDIT: Since everyone seems concerned about my health, I thought I would clarify that this sleeplessness is pretty standard for me, due to my bipolar disorder. I will often go days without sleep. However, this has been the longest I've gone awake without chemical assistance, so perhaps some concern is in order.

Continuing along the hallucinatory storm front, I tried to go to sleep over the last hour or so, ended up laying on my arm weird and now I can't get comfy. I am now hallucinating those annoying flying saw things with the red light that chases you down at the start of HL2.

In any case, if I do not get to sleep within the next 4 hours, I will seek medical attention. Thanks for worrying about me.

Fucking headcrab zombies, gurgling outside my door...

German

French (French Foreign Legion!)

Zulu

Ethiopian

This is the period generally known as New Imperialism, which focused on the unexplored regions of Africa, along with uniting Europe. It ended with the World Wars, after which the globe was split into the First, Second and Third Worlds and outright conflict was avoided for proxy wars and weapons proliferation. Weaponry would evolve from the muzzle-loading rifle to the repeating rifle to the submachine gun. Ships would evolve from ironclads to dreadnoughts to battleships to submarines. Scout aircraft, bombers and fighter planes and zeppelins would appear midway through the game's progression. Horses are later replaced by cars and tanks.

"Hi reddit, need help finding the name of this game!","This is an amazing PC game I used to play back in high school (late 90's). I have vague memories of it and I can't remember the name. Please help me out I am dying to play again. 

It was a 2D space fighter shooting game, where players could pick up items, build turrets, have shields, different missiles... There were also spawn areas and teleporters. 
(2 players could play at the same time on one keyboard)

You could either play multi-player against each other, or play a single arcade style game with levels. There were also a range of ships you could choose from. 

This is an image I drew of some of the elements in the game including the ships. Again, I only have a vague memory of the game. I know I'm not putting a lot of information in here but I hope you guys could help me out.",gaming
"Does anyone else play Multiwinia? It's in the 
Introversion pack. Try it out!","Multiwinia is this really crazy RTS by Introversion, the makers of Darwinia. It takes place in the same universe with the same units and settings: retro blocky pixel units on a sparse polygon landscape and sky.

It's an RTS that doesn't take itself too seriously: games are rarely fair, item drops are random, and battles often end up seriously one-sided, but that's what makes it so much fun. It's more about mass controlling armies and macro than micro, and so much luck.

If you don't have Multiwinia or haven't played it, take a look at the gameplay video.

I'm posting this because I know a lot of you picked up the Introversion pack when it was on sale for $5, but nobody ever plays Multiwinia online even though there are always servers up. It's a ton of fun to play with real people, and it's the kind of whimsical game Reddit seems to like.

I've fucking had it with Blizzard forever. Worst customer support ever.,"So, I just decided to start playing Diablo II again and purchased it from Blizzard's online store. The code they sent to my email DIDN'T WORK when I followed their directions and tried to enter it to their website and download the game. I simply got an error message that it'd already been used. WTF?!

So... of course I call their 800#... This is the second time I've tried to actually reach a human being at Blizzard in the past a month. The last time was after my WoW account was hacked and subsequently banned. This was resolved after an email and an EIGHT DAY WAIT(!)

Between these two situations and multiple calls to their customer service line over several days, I have never once NOT had the following message: ""press 1 for English. we're sorry, but we are experiencing high call volume and our hold queue is full. we cannot accept your call at this time.""

How can a company making so much money be so godawful at solving their customer's problems in prompt fashion?

Fuck blizzard. My pirated copy of Diablo II will be complete in another 10 minutes.

"If ACTA passes, almost everyone in this subreddit will be criminally liable for at least one felony.","ACTA is a global anti-counterfeiting (and anti-piracy) agreement that threatens to destroy the internet as we know it.

It would give federal officials the right to inspect your files without a warrant.

It would make unauthorized possession of copyrighted material a *federal crime.*

And there's nowhere in the developed world you'd be able to go to escape it, because they're all on board. US, Canada, EU, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, NZ, Australia.

This lays the groundwork for the most totalitarian century the world has ever seen. I've posted it to /r/gaming because many, many people in this subreddit have reason to be personally concerned by the passage of this law. Government continues catering to corporations instead of to people; we're on our way to corporate fascism. We should try to stop it any way we can.

**Edit:** Here are some useful links to information about ACTA.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation explaining what ACTA is and what you can do about it.

Wikipedia describing ACTA in detail, including participatory countries, controversy, and some potential effects.

The leaked ACTA agreement itself, hosted on TPB. Careful, going there could get you labeled a felon if this passes.

**Edit 2:** Someone provided a link to this very interesting review of ACTA from just a few weeks ago by the American University Washington College of Law. Experts on intellectual property from all over the world gathered in Washington DC to discuss ACTA, and this statement is their conclusion; it goes into detail about what's wrong with ACTA and why. The tl;dr is that ACTA is being misrepresented by the powers that be. It violates WTO agreements and threatens public interests.",gaming

Which subscription is worth it more to you Reddit?  PSN+ or XBG?,"I have both the PS3 and XBOX360 for some time (I'm sure Reddit has the same situation) and I can't decide which way I should lean on getting a subscription?  I've had Gold and PSN used to be free.  Now I have nothing since my subscription ran out on the 360 and I'm hesitant to get the PSN+.

Background:  I enjoy both PS3 and 360 equally.  The only thing is that the majority of my friends have 360's and play COD/BC2/etc; games that I do not fully enjoy as I grew up on PC FPS's.  So ultimately I have equal motivation towards either.  

And I can't see myself spending ~$100+ for both if I'm getting some of the same stuff.  Is it worth it to get both?

"An Important Point: Blizzard Entertainment is part of Activision Blizzard, and I believe they should be referred to as such.","Recently, Blizzard Entertainment has been making a push to be more and more like Facebook.  They want real names everywhere.  Some of the changes have been good: the RealID feature before the forum announcement was pretty rockin', especially with the incoming cross-game chatting.  However, from the Bnet 2.0 stuff with StarCraft to the RealID on their forums, they're definitely pushing into territory that a lot of gamers aren't happy with: neutering some services and overreaching with us.

Many of us blame the Activision corporate philosophy for this.  They are most certainly a business first, rather than gamers first.

I have a proposal, however: when you talk about Blizzard with your friends, when you write blog posts, and when you post on reddit, refer to them as **Activision Blizzard.**  I think this is a pretty negative PR point for them, and if we, the gaming community, want to keep our gaming from being context-ad-laden-social-networking-without-lan-or-chat-channels-pay-to-play-with-people-elsewhere-in-the-world, well, I think we need to fight back.  I think the Activision Blizzard change is a good idea.  What say you?

* Mass Effect (I can borrow 2 from a friend when he's done so I won't be buying it)
* Battlefield: Bad Company 2 (multiplayer only, I'll probably trade this one in)
* I am currently playing Dragon Age Origins, it started slow but I am getting into it.
* Left 4 Dead (and L4D2) (might trade these in)
* I liked the Crackdown 2 demo but doubt the game is worth the $55 it costs as a new release.

**Games I played recently that I wasn't really into:**

* Fallout 3 (long winded and boring)
* Bioshock (I just wasn't feeling it, I don't care for the creepy-atmosphere games)
* Borderlands (but I only tried single player, not co-op)

**Games I have borrowed but not played yet:**

* Batman Arkham Asylum
* Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion (I've been told I might not like this one since I didn't like Fallout 3)

**Games I have a bit of an interest in:**

* The first Crackdown ($14 new at Amazon)
* GTA IV (can probably get it used for cheap)
* SW: Knights of the Old Republic for the original xbox (it seems finding it is the hard part)
* Red Dead Redemption (I can probably borrow this when my friend is done, though)
* Gears of War 1 and 2

Can you help me find a PC game for my dad?,"My dad's never been too much of a gamer.  He played Madden, NBA Live, Mario Kart, and Red Alert 2 with me when I lived at home with him.  I'm looking for a PC game I can play with him.  He's a smart guy, but never has had the hardcore gaming reflexes I have.

Our favorite was Red Alert 2.  We'd play skirmishes against 2, 3, 4 computers of increasing strengths, and also played against friends in real life.  Eventually the game kind of died.  From what I understand, you can't even play it over LAN anymore because it uses an outdated protocol.  Even if this isn't true, looking for something new.

I've gotten him playing Civ IV, and we have fun with that, but we're also looking for something where we can play more on a team together, and more fast-paced.  

Another RTS would be optimal.  I've decided that SC and SC2 are out.  I can't handle the micro, much less my dad.  Company of Heroes seems a bit too much as well.  RA2 was mostly about producing the right troops in the right amounts and sending them to the right places.  Very little micro beyond that.

I bought him Call of Duty 2 (not MW), hoping to get him some FPS experience so maybe I can wean him into TF2.  I think WoW would be his speed, but no way he'd play an MMORPG, haha.

What are your favorite side scrollers and why?,"I'm asking this because I've gotten the bug to do some game programming in my down time, and I figured I would start with a side scroller. Everyone complains (me included) that all of our amazing hardware is being used on making beautiful 3D tripe, and that true innovation and staying power lies in game play, not in cut scenes, bloom, and high poly models. So, I figure, if I can find some of the patterns which underly great 2D games, I can put that knowledge to use.


1. Super Mario Bros. 3.

   I loved the various different power ups you could get, and the levels that went with the accompanying suits. 

2. Contra
 
   I loved the variations on the weapons. Even though there were only a few weapons, I liked how sometimes getting that different weapon upgrade would make or break the next encounter. Should you have kept the spread gun, or will the laser be useful for the next boss?

3. Mega Man 1, 2, 3 (I didn't play any others. I might have played X or X2 or something)

   I really liked the power ups. (I think I like power ups, customization, and the variation that tackling a challenge with a different set of tools provides.) The bosses were an extended paper rock scissors set, and I found that to be a fun challenge, discovering which powers worked best against which bosses.

4. R-Types

   Hey, this game featured a rich set of power ups as well. I don't like how these types of games are a memory test, more than a skills test. There are so many pitfalls in these types of games, where you get a choice of branches, and you can't tell until it's too late that the branch you chose is either a dead end (literally) or not. What I did like about this game type is how it constantly challenges you with various different innovative enemies, with new features and abilities. 

1. Metroid

   So many power ups in this game. Resource management with ammunition and energy. Non-linear progression was one of the most exciting features of this game, to me. I liked how you can acquire power ups and health increases in an exploratory fashion. Exploration was part of what made this game a ton of fun.

 
6. Castlevania: Symphony of the Night

   This was an action adventure RPG the likes of which I have not come back into contact with. The non-linear nature of the castle exploration, the experience progression and ability unlocking, and the weapon upgrade system all came together to make this game a joy to play.",gaming

Anyhow, on my way to that I came up with this alphabet of game companies, let me know what you think:



A is for Activison - They're defined by sequels and greed

B is for Blizzard - Who now follow Activision's steez

C is for Capcom - Their fighting games are the best

D is for D3 Publisher - Who bring us games too strange for the rest

E is for -Enix and -Eidos - of Square hyphen fame

F is for FASA - Defunct but awesome all the same

G is for Gameloft - Among cellphone porting studios their crap is the best

H is for Haemimont - whose city sims are different than the rest

I is for Interplay - ""Despite rumors to the contrary, we are not dead""

K is for Konami - Thier press conferences can't be beat

L is for Lucasarts - Whose adventure games are neat

M is for Microsoft - scheming and strategizing every day

N is for Nintendo - who make the games we play

O is for Obsidian - never a bug-free game put to bed

P is for Pandemic - even though they're dead

Q is for Q? Entertainment - Musically inclined

R is for Rockstar - Open world defined

S is for Sega - Kings of the arcade

T is for TakeTwo - *Nothing clever to say about them, please help!*

U is for Ubisoft - Who try to kill their fanbase with drm

V is for Valve - Whose fanservice can't be beat

W is for WB Games - I can't think of anything clever, so I'll end with ""meat!""

X is for XSEED - importers extraordinaire
 
Y is for Yuke's - whose wrestling games can't compare

Z is for Zygna - The end?",gaming
What is your favorite sequel; the one that you think did everything right.,"Not necessarily favorite game, but the game that improved upon it's predecessor in very significant ways.

Mine is Majora's Mask. That's saying a lot considering what it was the sequel to. It had so many improvements, large and small, over Ocarina of Time. Pretty much every complaint that I had with OoT was addressed. It also managed to significantly change the Zelda formula, while still being incredibly fun and feeling like a Zelda game. I also have yet to play another game that has a similar main gameplay mechanic. I wish more sequels were that ambitious and weren't afraid to stray from convention a little.

The runner up would have to be Bangai-O spirits.",gaming

"Reddit, I wrecked my car and need new games to play. Looking for suggestions!","I recently graduated school and have been looking for a job. In the meantime, I have been helping my parents around the house and taking some courses to fill up my time with. I have been pretty proactive with my time - taking up running and other exercise, going back and reading books that I meant to finish but wasn't able to during the semester, etc...

However, with my car now gone, I have too much time on my hands. I have done as many odd jobs as I can for my parents and until this job search pulls through I have more time on my hands than I can do with.

I recently finished the Half Life Series and plan on going back and finishing up Mass Effect and then Mass Effect 2. What games would you guys consider to be a must have?",gaming

Thief: Deadly Shadows - $3
Civilization 4 + Expansion Pack  - $10

Blizzard caught me trolling...,"I guess this is the kind of trolling they want to stop.

"So, I beat Dragon Age: Origins and it was awesome, but kinda disappointing","When I played this game previously (on the 360, played it on PC now), I didn't get very far past Ostagar so I didn't get to experience the majority of the story or character development, which is what took me by surprise this time around. Sure the story was riddled with cliches as is typical of BioWare games, but there was one thing in particular that struck me for some reason, and this might be kinda spoilery. After you do Leliana's personal quest and talk to her about it in the camp, you can make her believe she was lying to herself about enjoying time spent in the Chantry. The best part about this is her whole attitude towards everything changes and she becomes less judgmental and righteous.

It doesn't seem that big of a deal anymore when choices the player makes effect the story, but I can't remember playing a game where something my character said made such a huge impact on another character and actually seemed like a genuine change. Other things that stood out to me were the Dwarven city and the Deep Roads as well as the later parts of the Sacred Ashes questline. These were, by far, the best parts of the game in my opinion, but I also think there's a lot of room for improvement.

My biggest gripe with the game is that it's so close to being really immersive, but seems like it's half-assed. There's clearly a lot of effort put into the backstory to make the entire world believable which is awesome. But, the world doesn't really feel alive. The NPCs all just stand there like robots waiting for someone to come and press the on button. Named NPCs have generic, bland, uninteresting drops when most of them should have a unique item of some sort. It has a weird sort of effect where the past feels more living than the present.

Another problem: invisible walls. In a big, epic, game like Dragon Age, invisible walls kill the fun for me. You can go into some awesome, interesting areas like the Deep Roads, but you really go anywhere and explore anything. I couldn't help but think how much fun I would have if that whole Deep Roads map were open to exploration or if I could see more of Orzammar. Similarly, I think it would have been a better choice to have the world map connected ala Oblivion instead of specific zones.

I was about to buy Awakening (even at the non-sale price) simply because I enjoyed the original enough, but after reading more about it I don't think that I will. The fact that your party and more importantly any love interest you had previously doesn't carry over bothers me and makes it seem like it was a rushjob and they threw the whole choice thing out the window.

I really hope they make some improvements in the second full game because Origins is really close to being a perfect game.

tl;dr: story is good, character development is awesome, but the immersion aspect needs work",gaming

Anyone else quitting Blizzard games over this?,"I respect the folks who are emailing Blizzard with their concerns.  But that's not the path for me.  Blizzard has crossed a line.  They've demonstrated to me that they simply don't care (nor will they ever care) about their customers.  Sure, maybe enough hate mail will get Blizzard to back down on this round.  But that just means their marketing folks will hide in the shadows and strike again when we're not paying attention.

I play games to relax.  I didn't sign up for a never-ending vigil against Blizzard's creep tumor of privacy invasion.

This is not a case of a ""misreading"" of the customers.  Blizzard clearly has been pushing this idiotic Facebooklization of their games for a long time.  This is part of their long term strategy to ""connect"" us whether we want to or not.

So I say FUCK THEM.  I love this game.  I love it to death.  I love Reddit's Starcraft community, I love Day9, Joshy, Husky, HD, and TLO.

But you know what?  Sometimes protecting your rights means giving up something you truly love.  

I'm not going to play another game of StarCraft until Blizzard not only reverses this forum policy, but also takes away the stupid Real ID in games, and also apologizes profusely for even pulling this stunt in the first place.

Since that day will never come, then well, I guess it is good bye StarCraft.  You have been a good friend for a very long time.  I'll miss you, but I have a feeling if I don't draw the line right now, Blizzard's strategy will be the norm and pretty soon no company will respect my privacy in any shape or form. 

I'm not just talking about gaming companies here, just look at the crap Google and Facebook are constantly trying to pull with their ""surprise opt in"" social media changes.  Draw the line folks, before it is too late.",gaming
I hate cut scenes in games.  I really do.,"Surely I'm not alone in this.  I play video games so that I can be actively engaged.  I rarely watch TV or movies for the same reason.  For me cut scenes really defeat the purpose of gaming.

I'd say the worst offender I've encountered was MGS4.  I know it was a wildly successful game and everyone seemed to love it, but I felt like I spent more time watching than I did playing.  I seriously hated the entire game because the cut scenes never seemed to end.

Anyone else agree with me that cut scenes need to go the way of the dodo?",gaming
More people need to play Global Agenda,"Class based free to play sci-fi MMO shooter (holy crap that's a mouthful) that will blow your socks off.

Ok so the free trial has been temporarily disabled because of the recent influx of players following the abolition of subscriptions but trust me it is a fantastic game combining elements from many much loved favourites (Tribes, TF2, etc.) as well as its own unique features.

Fantastic PvP system with a great Conquest style Agency vs. Agency map and if you're not into the PvE can be more than challenging in many aspects. The game has great diversity between the classes so as to always have something more to offer and not to mention a brilliant community. Give it a shot.


And it's on Steam. Which kinda rocks.",gaming
Real IDs and Blizzard. Stop whining.,"Too many people are whining over this Real ID situation going on with Blizzard. So your first name and last name are exposed and you're afraid because you don't trust people you don't know and you're afraid that employers will not hire you because you spend a lot of time playing video games. If that isn't textbook cynicism then I don't fucking know what is.

Think about it this way, it's not just you that is exposed for playing blizzard games online. It's every single person that plays blizzard games online. You get exposed and they get exposed. That means employers too most definitely will be exposed if they play those games and on top of all that just maybe more than half of the damn applicants for a job position will be in the same damn boat as you are seeing how popular Blizzard games just are. If an employer is going to rule you out just because you have a hobby he or she doesn't agree with then they're probably not worth working for in the first place. Someone like that makes bad subjective judgment calls and shouldn't be in the position they hold anyway.

Blizzard knew before they even came up with the idea that people wouldn't take it without a fight. They would have had to because they're a company made up of mostly gamers themselves. They aren't stupid nor have they lost their minds. They're doing a scientific experiment of sorts. Their hypothesis is that everything works smoothly and people who play blizzard games act less retarded so they don't have to filter through the trolls wrapping their bullshit around gamers that just want to have a decent discussion in a setting where blizzard employees can also comment and listen in. People backing down because they're afraid of this are the same people that blizzard wants to do away with on their forums because most of these people are contributing to the problem on a regular basis more so often than they choose to say something with brevity and importance in mind. They'll think twice about posting and avoid doing so unless they seriously have something important to say. It makes perfect sense. You're not breaking their experiment by avoiding posting your stupid useless jargon, you're only strengthening the outcome.

If you have something to say on their forums, put more effort into your words and make damn sure you make your point clearly. Be less trivial and post with tact and decorum in mind. The voting system on posts is what you now use as a streamline for all the bullshit insults and reckless banter against someone's opinion as well as a simple agreement. The strength of this concept allows Blizzard to extract the major points out of an argument or get a suggestion that the community agrees upon so they can change or implement something faster. It's a good thing. 

Get used to it. If you don't like it... Make a damn sub-reddit and bitch away ;P",gaming

"Hi Hi /r/Gaming, am I the only one feeling like the video-game industry has being going bad shit nuts over the last few months?","Ok, here's the deal. I'm a 20yo French dude. When I was a kid, I had a GameBoy, a GameGear, a Super Nes, a Mega Drive and A PS One, I've had my very own computer to play with at the age of 15, and opened a Steam account approximately at the same time. I started playing WoW something like 3 years ago. In spite of all of this, I know I've been missing a couple of angular stones in the vg history, still I like buying/playing oldies.

But what the fuck is going on? Last year, Activision (for some reason that still needs to be totally clarified) entirely wipes a company from the market, a company that had made 2 best sellers in 20 months. A couple of months later, Ubisoft (cock a doodle) sets the sadly famous DRM system that needs users to be continually connected to their servers in order to play solo games like Assassin's Creed 2. Result of the Experiment: the target of this system becomes the living proof that illegal downloading is more convenient than buying the game etc etc.
Now Blizzard (or Activision again, whatever) decides that their best-sellers, the one they have sold God knows how many million copies, the one that has 11 million (and still growing) regular players is gonna become a Facebook App just like Farmville.
I mean, what are we waiting for? Gabe Newell announcing that Steam is going to need a monthly fee just like Onlive Gaming?

Ok, the entertainment industry is quite young (30 years?) and has literally exploded over the last decade. But, the guys who are running it were gamers once, they have become business executives who would rather chose short-term profit over long-term customer-fidelity.

While I understand that this does happen, how common is it?  Has anyone *actually* had their application denied or been fired because their boss found out they played games?  Obviously if you start showing up late for work because you decided to finish a raid, or gaming otherwise impacts your job performance, then you have issues with your priorities.

Edit:  I think I should clarify what I need a little better.  The skill I want to improve is my raw ability to place the crosshair on the enemy and pull the trigger at the right time, consistently, when and where I want to.",gaming
Great free games that can run on a moderately good computer?,Do you know any? Which ones would you suggest highly? I tried dwarf fortress but could not get around how steep the learning curve is.,gaming
"Reddit, how good is RDR's co-op?","Currently, there is a 45 dollar free shipping deal for RDR at amazon.  My dad, who lives a few states away owns his own copy, which he was going to let me borrow when he was finished, and I have a friend who was also planning on buying the game. 

Is the co-op worth paying 45 dollars for in order to play with my dad, or should I wait for him to finish?",gaming
"Playing video games with my girlfriend this week, need some suggestions!","Hey all, I'm playing video games with my girlfriend this week and I was just open for suggestions as to what some good multi-player video games for the Xbox 360 were.

i feel like im the only one that is pro-real id here,"i use my real name for most forums. it keeps me accountable for everything i say. im not afraid of stalkers or potential murderers any more than i would be of people i would meet in real life that could get the same information very easily [example ]. the one valid reason not to want real id i guess would be girls getting stalked. but people are acting like this real id shit will have a zerg of thousands of basement dwellers driving cross country in a blitzkrieg to rape fellow guildies. if this were true, yes i would be against that. but i think this is a rare worse case scenario and that every other objection is weak. and its really only to post in the official bliz forums.  if i were that worried about it i would: not post, find another forum, or take care of what i say on there.",gaming
Was anyone else incredibly disappointed by White Knight Chronicles? SPOILERS,"I just finished the game... what the hell? That shouldn't have been the end of the game... it was short as hell, I only had two Gundams (didn't even MEET the fifth Gundam), I didn't defeat the game's major villain. I thought that that final battle would end with me getting Kara back and receiving my third Knight. It feels like the game ended a third of the way to where it should have.

I feel incredibly ripped off by this game right now. And as someone working in the industry designing games I'm astounded by how bad a design choice this was. The game was great up until this point.

tl;dr Don't buy White Knight Chronicles",gaming

I just started Riven and I'm making a commitment to not use a guide.,"I just started Riven and it is an amazing game. I made sure to read every bit of flavor text to get sucked in as much as possible. So far I have  a page of notes and half a page with a crude map. I heard the number 5 was very important but if anyone has very subtle hints that I should jot down that would be nice.

Also: Is there a way to increase the resolution?

"[Dead Horse Beating] RealID = Bad, we get it. But why the uproar? Do we need those forums that bad?","I don't understand all the fuss, real id is for blizzard forums and no one in their right mind ever used them anyway, blizzard games are so popular that the signal/noise ratio was abysmal on those, we just have another good reason not to ever go there.

I agree that RealId is a shitty idea, dangerous etc.. but I fail to understand the uproar : it doesn't affect the games, so could someone explain what is so great about those forums that makes them worth calling for boycotts ?

My guess is blizzard just wanted to reduce the stupidity level in their forums (In which they will fail, since only the utterly stupid will keep on using them).

TL;DR : Pressing Alt-Crtl-øž+middle mouse button in SC2 will summon a Zergling to kill you and rape your dog. PRO-Tip : Don't do it.",gaming
Why I agree (partially) with Roger Ebert,"I've thought about it a lot and I think I've come to accept that Ebert has a really good point about video games. At least it made me think of one. It's easy to call him an ""old man"" and write him off as ""not getting it,"" but that's overly dismissive. Man has been a critic for decades and an amazing one at that, his opinion should be given consideration.

Anyway, I think that most of the criticism of his comments have fundamentally misunderstood both his point (or what I understand to be his point) and the deeper issue. People saying, ""Is script writing art? Is 3d modeling art? Is texture creation art? Why is their combination in a video game NOT art?"" are the ones I'm talking about. I think Ebert would definitely agree that all of the above is art, but all of the above is NOT a game. A game is not the models, a game is not the writing, a game is not the textures, or the buildings, or the cinematography. When Ebert says video GAMES cannot be art he's speaking to the most essential part of these things, the game. Think of it this way: Is the game of chess art? A chess set can clearly be art, but the chess set is immaterial to the game itself. Are the rules of chess art? I would say they are not, but I know that point is arguable (art, IMO, should evoke emotion, or be specifically designed not to evoke emotion, with minimal context outside of the work).

So, can games be art now becomes a much more interesting question. And the answer is, I think, yes. Although they almost never are with video games. Video games use graphics and writing to tell a story, to establish and explore themes, to create atmosphere. The mechanics themselves are rarely used to do any of that, to evoke any emotions at all. And if they are used, it's usually just a bit of atmosphere inherent in the mechanics. I can think of very few games where the mechanics really established or even reinforced the theme. And that's a shame, because the game, the rules which say how the player can interact with the work, is the big advantage video games have over TV and movies. 

There is an area where I think games have really become art: tabletop RPGs. Not a lot of mainstream ones, many of which are simply skirmish scale wargames with persistent characters, but a great deal of small press games. You see rules used to establish and reinforce a theme, to drive players to make hard choices about a central issue. Rules that are designed to evoke a certain emotion or mood. Rules that are entirely integrated with the type of story that game is designed for. An old and easily remembered example (haven't been into the RPG scene for a while) is Sorcerer. The central question of the game is, ""What do you want and what are you willing to do to get it?"" The mechanics are all designed to force the player to ask that question. They allow the players access to a huge amount of power, right off the bat. However, there are costs, there are always costs. It's meant to lead to a game of escalating risks, where you end up summoning more and more powerful demons (although the meaning of both ""summoning"" and ""demon"" are entirely malleable) to deal with your troubles, each demon you dragging you in deeper. That's game rules as art. That's where video games should go.

And, once that kind of thing is prevalent, THEN you can tell Ebert to fuck off. 

tl;dr: Ebert isn't saying art becomes non-art when put into a video game. He's saying the game part isn't art. A chess set is sculpture which is definitely art, but the rules of chess are not. A cereal box may have art on the front, that doesn't make cereal art.",gaming
What is your favorite music from any video game?,"Could be classic or something more recent.

I'm a fan of just about anything from Sonic (1,2, and Sonic and Knuckles).
Also thought Final Fantasy X had a great soundtrack.

 (To Zanarkand - FFX)",gaming
"Damnit, can someone help me remember the name of this game?","I just saw the post about The Dig (I loved that game when I was a kid), and it reminded me of another game I had around the same time.  In this game, you were stuck on a spaceship of some sort that you were trying to fix up.  It was a first person view, kind of similar to Myst I guess.  I remember getting to the end, and encountering some sort of crippling bug that kept me from finishing the game.  I would love to hunt this game down and finally finish it, but for the life of me I cannot remember the name or much else about it.

edit: The main screen that I remember had a bunch of tubes that you needed to repair and fill up with some sort of green slime, which I think restored power to a part of the ship. Also you had some equipment like a multitool and a device that detected radiation.

edit #2: dinx2582 found it, the game is Mission Critical, released in 1996 by Legend Entertainment.",gaming
